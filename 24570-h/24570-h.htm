<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on a cool, starlit evening, early in September,
1916, that I first met Drew of Massachusetts,
and actually began my adventures as
a prospective member of the Escadrille Am&eacute;ricaine.
We had sailed from New York by the
same boat, had made our applications for enlistment
in the Foreign Legion on the same
day, without being aware of each other's existence;
and in Paris, while waiting for our papers,
we had gone, every evening, for dinner, to the
same large and gloomy-looking restaurant in
the neighborhood of the Seine.</p>

<p>As for the restaurant, we frequented it, not
assuredly because of the quality of the food.
We might have dined better and more cheaply
elsewhere. But there was an air of vanished
splendor, of faded magnificence, about the
place which, in the capital of a warring nation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
appealed to both of us. Every evening the
tables were laid with spotless linen and shining
silver. The wineglasses caught the light from
the tarnished chandeliers in little points of
color. At the dinner-hour, a half-dozen ancient
serving-men silently took their places about the
room. There was not a sound to be heard except
the occasional far-off honk of a motor or
the subdued clatter of dishes from the kitchens.
The serving-men, even the tables and the
empty chairs, seemed to be listening, to be
waiting for the guests who never came. Rarely
were there more than a dozen diners-out during
the course of an evening. There was something
mysterious in these elaborate preparations,
and something rather fine about them as
well; but one thought, not without a touch of
sadness, of the old days when there had been
laughter and lights and music, sparkling wines
and brilliant talk, and how those merrymakers
had gone, many of them, long ago to the wars.</p>

<p>As it happened on this evening, Drew and
I were sitting at adjoining tables. Our common
citizenship was our introduction, and after five
minutes of talk, we learned of our common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
purpose in coming to France. I suppose that
we must have eaten after making this latter
discovery. I vaguely remember seeing our old
waiter hobbling down a long vista of empty
tables on his way to and from the kitchens.
But if we thought of our food at all, it must
have been in a purely mechanical way.</p>

<p>Drew can talk&mdash;by Jove, how the man can
talk!&mdash;and he has the faculty of throwing the
glamour of romance over the most commonplace
adventures. Indeed, the difficulty which
I am going to have in writing this narrative is
largely due to this romantic influence of his. I
might have succeeded in writing a plain tale,
for I have kept my diary faithfully, from day
to day, and can set down our adventures, such
as they are, pretty much as they occurred. But
Drew has bewitched me. He does not realize
it, but he is a weaver of spells, and I am so enmeshed
in his moonshine that I doubt if I shall
be able to write of our experiences as they must
appear to those of our comrades in the Franco-American
Corps who remember them only
through the medium of the revealing light of
day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Not one of these men, I am sure, would confess
to so strange an immediate cause for joining
the aviation service, as that related to me by
Drew, as we sat over our coffee and cigarettes,
on the evening of our first meeting. He had
come to France, he said, with the intention of
joining the <i>L&eacute;gion &Eacute;trang&egrave;re</i> as an infantryman.
But he changed his mind, a few days after his
arrival in Paris, upon meeting Jackson of the
American Aviation Squadron, who was on
leave after a service of six months at the front.
It was all because of the manner in which Jackson
looked at a Turkish rug. He told him of his
adventures in the most matter-of-fact way. No
heroics, nothing of that sort. He had not a
glimmer of imagination, he said. But he had a
way of looking at the floor which was &#8220;irresistible,&#8221;
which &#8220;fascinated him with the sense of
height.&#8221; He saw towns, villages, networks of
trenches, columns of toy troops moving up ribbons
of road&mdash;all in the patterns of a Turkish
rug. And the next day, he was at the headquarters
of the Franco-American Corps, in the
Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, making application for membership.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It is strange that we should both have come
to France with so little of accurate knowledge of
the corps, of the possibilities for enlistment, and
of the nature of the requirements for the service.
Our knowledge of it, up to the time of sailing,
had been confined to a few brief references
in the press. It was perhaps necessary that its
existence should not be officially recognized in
America, or its furtherance encouraged. But
it seemed to us at that time, that there must
have been actual discouragement on the part of
the Government at Washington. However that
may be, we wondered if others had followed
clues so vague or a call so dimly heard.</p>

<p>This led to a discussion of our individual aptitudes
for the service, and we made many comforting
discoveries about each other. It is permissible
to reveal them now, for the particular
encouragement of others who, like ourselves at
that time, may be conscious of deficiencies,
and who may think that they have none of
the qualities essential to the successful aviator.
Drew had never been farther from the ground
than the top of the Woolworth building. I had
once taken a trip in a captive balloon. Drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knew nothing of motors, and had no more
knowledge of mechanics than would enable him
to wind a watch without breaking the mainspring.
My ignorance in this respect was a fair
match for his.</p>

<p>We were further handicapped for the French
service by our lack of the language. Indeed,
this seemed to be the most serious obstacle in
the way to success. With a good general knowledge
of the language it seemed probable that
we might be able to overcome our other deficiencies.
Without it, we could see no way to
mastering the mechanical knowledge which we
supposed must be required as a foundation for
the training of a military pilot. In this connection,
it may be well to say that we have both
been handicapped from the beginning. We have
had to learn, through actual experience in the
air, and at risk to life and limb, what many
of our comrades, both French and American,
knew before they had ever climbed into an aeroplane.
But it is equally true that scores of men
become very excellent pilots with little or no
knowledge of the mechanics of the business.</p>

<p>In so far as Drew and I were concerned, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
were matters for the future. It was enough for
us at the moment that our applications had
been approved, our papers signed, and that
to-morrow we were leaving for the <i>&Eacute;cole d'Aviation
Militaire</i> to begin our training. And so,
after a long evening of pleasant talk and pleasanter
anticipation of coming events, we left
our restaurant and walked together through
the silent streets to the Place de la Concorde.
The great windy square was almost deserted.
The monuments to the lost provinces bulked
large in the dim lamplight. Two disabled soldiers
hobbled across the bridge and disappeared
in the deep shade of the avenue. Their
service had been rendered, their sacrifices
made, months ago. They could look about
them now with a peculiar sense of isolation, and
with, perhaps, a feeling of the futility of the
effort they had made. Our adventures were
all before us. Our hearts were light and our
hopes high. As we stood by the obelisk, talking
over plans for the morrow, we heard, high
overhead, the faint hum of motors, and saw two
lights, one green, one red, moving rapidly across
the sky. A moment later the long, slender finger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of a searchlight probed among little heaps
of cloud, then, sweeping in a wide arc, revealed
in striking outline the shape of a huge biplane
circling over the sleeping city. It was one of the
night guard of Paris.</p>

<p>On the following morning, we were at the
Gare des Invalides with our luggage, a long
half-hour before train-time. The luggage was
absurdly bulky. Drew had two enormous suitcases
and a bag, and I a steamer trunk and a
family-size portmanteau. We looked so much
the typical American tourists that we felt
ashamed of ourselves, not because of our nationality,
but because we revealed so plainly,
to all the world military, our non-military antecedents.
We bore the hallmark of fifty years
of neutral aloofness, of fifty years of indifference
to the business of national defense. What
makes the situation amusing as a retrospect is
the fact that we were traveling on third-class
military passes, as befitted our rank as <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ve-pilotes</i>
and soldiers of the <i>deuxi&egrave;me classe</i>.</p>

<p>To our great discomfiture, a couple of <i>poilus</i>
volunteered their services in putting our belongings
aboard the train. Then we crowded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
into a third-class carriage filled with soldiers&mdash;<i>permissionnaires</i>,
<i>bless&eacute;s</i>, <i>r&eacute;form&eacute;s</i>, men from all
corners of France and her colonies. Their uniforms
were faded and weather-stained with
long service. The stocks of their rifles were
worn smooth and bright with constant usage,
and their packs fairly stowed themselves upon
their backs.</p>

<p>Drew and I felt uncomfortable in our smart
civilian clothing. We looked too soft, too clean,
too spick-and-span. We did not feel that we
belonged there. But in a whispered conversation
we comforted ourselves with the assurance
that if ever America took her rightful stand
with the Allies, in six months after the event,
hundreds of thousands of American boys
would be lugging packs and rifles with the same
familiarity of use as these French <i>poilus</i>. They
would become equally good soldiers, and soon
would have the same community of experience,
of dangers and hardships shared in common,
which make men comrades and brothers
in fact as well as in theory.</p>

<p>By the time we had reached our destination
we had persuaded ourselves into a much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
comfortable frame of mind. There we piled
into a cab, and soon we were rattling over the
cobblestones, down a long, sunlit avenue in the
direction of B&mdash;&mdash;. It was late of a mild afternoon
when we reached the summit of a high
plateau and saw before us the barracks and
hangars of the <i>&Eacute;cole d'Aviation</i>. There was not
a breath of air stirring. The sun was just sinking
behind a bank of crimson cloud. The earth
was already in shadow, but high overhead the
light was caught and reflected from the wings
of scores of <i>avions</i> which shone like polished
bronze and silver. We saw the long lines of
Bl&eacute;riot monoplanes, like huge dragon-flies, and
as pretty a sight in the air as heart could wish.
Farther to the left, we recognized Farman biplanes,
floating battleships in comparison with
the Bl&eacute;riots, and twin-motor Caudrons, much
more graceful and alert of movement.</p>

<p>But, most wonderful of all to us then, we
saw a strange, new <i>avion</i>,&mdash;a biplane, small,
trim, with a body like a fish. To see it in flight
was to be convinced for all time that man has
mastered the air, and has outdone the birds in
their own element. Never was swallow more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
consciously joyous in swift flight, never eagle
so bold to take the heights or so quick to reach
them. Drew and I gazed in silent wonder,
our bodies jammed tightly into the cab-window,
and our heads craned upward. We did
not come back to earth until our ancient,
earth-creeping conveyance brought up with a
jerk, and we found ourselves in front of a gate
marked &#8220;&Eacute;cole d'Aviation Militaire de B&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>After we had paid the cabman, we stood in
the road, with our mountain of luggage heaped
about us, waiting for something to happen. A
moment later a window in the administration
building was thrown open and we were greeted
with a loud and not over-musical chorus of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light&mdash;&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It all came from one throat, belonging to a
chap in leathers, who came down the drive to
give us welcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spotted you <i>toute suite</i>&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can
tell Americans at six hundred yards by their
hats. How's things in the States? Do you think
we're coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>We gave him the latest budget of home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
news, whereupon he offered to take us over to
the barracks. When he saw our luggage he
grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some equipment, believe me! <i>Attendez un
peu</i> while I commandeer a battalion of Annamites
to help us carry it, and we'll be on our
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Annamites, from Indo-China, who are
quartered at the camp for guard and fatigue
duty, came back with him about twenty strong,
and we started in a long procession to the barracks.
Later, we took a vindictive pleasure
in witnessing the beluggaged arrival of other
Americans, for in nine cases out of ten they
came as absurdly over-equipped as did we.</p>

<p>Our barracks, one of many built on the same
pattern, was a long, low wooden building,
weather-stained without and whitewashed
within. It had accommodation for about forty
beds. One end of the room was very manifestly
American. There was a phonograph on the
table, baseball equipment piled in one corner,
and the walls were covered with cartoons and
pictures clipped from American periodicals.
The other end was as evidently French, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
frugality and the neatness of its furnishings.
The American end of the room looked more
homelike, but the French end more military.
Near the center, where the two nations joined,
there was a very harmonious blending of these
characteristics.</p>

<p>Drew and I were delighted with all this. We
were glad that we were not to live in an exclusively
American barracks, for we wanted to
learn French; but more than this, we wanted to
live with Frenchmen on terms of barrack-room
familiarity.</p>

<p>By the time we had given in our papers at the
captain's office and had passed the hasty preliminary
examination of the medical officer, it
was quite dark. Flying for the day was over,
and lights gleamed cheerily from the barrack-room
windows. As we came down the principal
street of the camp, we heard the strains of
&#8220;Waiting for the Robert E. Lee,&#8221; to a gramophone
accompaniment, issuing from the <i>chambre
des Am&eacute;ricains</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;See them shuffle along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, ma honey babe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear that music and song.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It gave us the home feeling at once. Frenchmen
and Americans were singing together, the
Frenchmen in very quaint English, but hitting
off the syncopated time as though they had
been born and brought up to it as we Americans
have.</p>

<p>Over in one corner, a very informal class
in French-English pronunciation was at work.
Apparently, this was tongue-twisters' night.
&#8220;<i>Heureux</i>&#8221; was the challenge from the French
side, and &#8220;<i>Hooroo</i>&#8221; the nearest approach to a
pronunciation on the part of the Americans,
with many more or less remote variations on
this theme. An American, realizing how difficult
it is for a Frenchman to get his tongue
between his teeth, counter-challenged with
&#8220;Father, you are withered with age.&#8221; The result,
as might have been expected, was a series
of hissing sounds of <i>z</i>, whereupon there was an
answering howl of derision from all the Americans.
Up and down the length of the room
there were little groups of two and three, chatting
together in combinations of Franco-American
which must have caused all deceased professors
of modern languages to spin like midges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in their graves. And throughout all this before-supper
merriment, one could catch the feeling
of good-comradeship which, so far as my
experience goes, is always prevalent whenever
Frenchmen and Americans are gathered together.</p>

<p>At the <i>ordinaire</i>, at supper-time, we saw all
of the <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ve-pilotes</i> of the school, with the exception
of the non-commissioned officers, who
have their own mess. To Drew and me, but
newly come from remote America, it was a
most interesting gathering. There were about
one hundred and twenty-five in all, including
eighteen Americans. The large majority of the
Frenchmen had already been at the front in
other branches of army service. There were
artillerymen, infantrymen, marines,&mdash;in training
for the naval air-service,&mdash;cavalrymen, all
wearing the uniforms of the arm to which they
originally belonged. No one was dressed in a
uniform which distinguished him as an aviator;
and upon making inquiry, I found that there
is no official dress for this branch of the service.
During his period of training in aviation,
and even after receiving his military brevet, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pilot continues to wear the dress of his former
service, plus the wings on the collar, and the
star-and-wings insignia on his right breast.
This custom does not make for the fine uniform
appearance of the men of the British Royal
Flying Corps, but it gives a picturesqueness
of effect which is, perhaps, ample recompense.
As for the Americans, they follow individual
tastes, as we learned later. Some of them, with
an eye to color, salute the sun in the red trousers
and black tunic of the artilleryman. Others
choose more sober shades, various French blues,
with the thin orange aviation stripe running
down the seams of the trousers. All this in
reference to the dress uniform. At the camp
most of the men wear leathers, or a combination
of leathers and the gray-blue uniform of
the French <i>poilu</i>, which is issued to all Americans
at the time of their enlistment.</p>

<p>We had a very excellent supper of soup, followed
by a savory roast of meat, with mashed
potatoes and lentils. Afterward, cheese and
beer. I was slightly discomfited physically on
learning that the beef was horse-meat, but
Drew convinced me that it was absurd to let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
old scruples militate against a healthy appetite.
In 1870 the citizens of France ate <i>rago&ucirc;t de chat</i>
with relish. Furthermore, the roast was of so
delicious a flavor and so closely resembled the
finest cuts of beef, that it was easy to persuade
one's self that it was beef, after all.</p>

<p>After the meal, to our great surprise, every
one cleaned his dishes with huge pieces of
bread. Such waste seemed criminal in a country
beleaguered by submarines, in its third
year of war, and largely dependent for its food-supply
on the farm labor of women and children.
We should not have been surprised if it
had been only the Americans who indulged in
this wasteful dish-cleansing process; but the
Frenchmen did it, too. When I remarked upon
this to one of my American comrades, a Frenchman,
sitting opposite, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, monsieur, but I must tell you what
we Frenchmen are. We are very economical
when it is for ourselves, for our own families
and purses, that we are saving. But when it is
the Government which pays the bill, we do not
care. We do not have to pay directly and so
we waste, we throw away. We are so careful at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
home, all of our lives, that this is a little pleasure
for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have had this same observation made to me
by so many Frenchmen since that time, that
I believe there must be a good deal of truth
in it.</p>

<p>After supper, all of the Americans adjourned
for coffee to Ciret's, a little caf&eacute; in the village
which nestles among the hills not far from the
camp. The caf&eacute; itself was like any one of thousands
of French provincial restaurants. There
was a great dingy common room, with a sanded
brick floor, and faded streamers of tricolor
paper festooned in curious patterns from the
smoky ceiling. The kitchen was clean, and
filled with the appetizing odor of good cooking.
Beyond it was another, inner room, &#8220;<i>toujours
r&eacute;serv&eacute;e &agrave; mes Am&eacute;ricains</i>,&#8221; as M. Ciret, the
fat, genial <i>patron</i> continually asserted. Here we
gathered around a large circular table, pipes
and cigarettes were lighted, and, while the
others talked, Drew and I listened and gathered
impressions.</p>

<p>For a time the conversation did not become
general, and we gathered up odds and ends of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
it from all sides. Then it turned to the reasons
which had prompted various members of the
group to come to France, the topic, above all
others, which Drew and I most wanted to hear
discussed. It seemed to me, as I listened, that
we Americans closely resemble the British in
our sensitive fear of any display of fine personal
feeling. We will never learn to examine our
emotions with anything but suspicion. If we
are prompted to a course of action by generous
impulses, we are anxious that others shall not
be let into the secret. And so it was that of all
the reasons given for offering their services to
France, the first and most important was the
last to be acknowledged, and even then it was
admitted by some with a reluctance nearly
akin to shame. There was no man there who
was not ready and willing to give his life, if
necessary, for the Allied cause, because he believed
in it; but the admission could hardly
have been dragged from him by wild horses.</p>

<p>But the adventure of the life, the peculiar
fascination of it&mdash;that was a thing which
might be discussed without reserve, and the
men talked of it with a willingness which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
most gratifying to Drew and me, curious as we
were about the life we were entering. They were
all in the flush of their first enthusiasms. They
were daily enlarging their conceptions of distance
and height and speed. They talked a new
language and were developing a new cast of
mind. They were like children who had grown
up over night, whose horizons had been immeasurably
broadened in the twinkling of an eye.
They were still keenly conscious of the change
which was upon them, for they were but fledgling
aviators. They were just finding their
wings. But as I listened, I thought of the time
which must come soon, when the air, as the sea,
will be filled with stately ships, and how the
air-service will develop its own peculiar type of
men, and build up about them its own laws and
its own traditions.</p>

<p>As we walked back through the straggling
village street to the camp, I tried to convey to
Drew something of the new vision which had
come to me during the evening. I was aglow
with enthusiasm and hoped to strike an answering
spark from him. But all that I was thinking
and feeling then he had thought and felt long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
before. I am sure that he had already experienced,
in imagination, every thrill, every keen
joy, and every sudden sickening fear which the
life might have in store for him. For this reason
I forgave him for his rather bored manner
of answering to my mood, and the more willingly
because he was full of talk about a strange
illusion which he had had at the restaurant.
During a moment of silence, he had heard a
clatter of hoof-beats in the village street. (I
had heard them too. Some one rode by furiously.)
Well, Drew said that he almost jumped
from his seat, expecting M. Ciret to throw open
the door and shout, &#8220;The British are coming!&#8221;
He actually believed for a second or two that
it was the year 1775, and that he was sitting in
one of the old roadside inns of Massachusetts.
The illusion was perfect, he said.</p>

<p>Now, why&mdash;etc., etc. At another time I
should have been much interested; but in the
presence of new and splendid realities I could
not summon any enthusiasm for illusions.
Nevertheless, I should have had to listen to him
indefinitely, had it not been for an event which
cut short all conversation and ended our first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
day at the <i>&Eacute;cole d'Aviation</i> in a truly spectacular
manner.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard the roar of motors just
over the barracks, and, at the same time, the
siren sounded the alarm in a series of prolonged,
wailing shrieks. Some belated pilot was still
in the air. We rushed out to the field just as
the flares were being lighted and placed on the
ground in the shape of an immense T, with
the cross-bar facing in the direction from which
the wind was coming. By this time the hum
of motors was heard at a great distance, but
gradually it increased in volume and soon the
light of the flares revealed the machine circling
rapidly over the <i>piste</i>. I was so much absorbed
in watching it man&oelig;uvre for a landing that I
did not see the crowd scattering to safe distances.
I heard many voices shouting frantic
warnings, and so ran for it, but, in my excitement,
directly within the line of descent of the
machine. I heard the wind screaming through
the wires, a terrifying sound to the novice, and
glancing hurriedly over my shoulder, I saw
what appeared to be a monster of gigantic proportions,
almost upon me. It passed within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
three metres of my head and landed just beyond.</p>

<p>When at last I got to sleep, after a day filled
with interesting incidents, Paul Revere pursued
me relentlessly through the mazes of a
weird and horrible dream. I was on foot, and
shod with lead-soled boots. He was in a huge,
twin-motor Caudron and flying at a terrific
pace, only a few metres from the ground. I can
see him now, as he leaned far out over the hood
of his machine, an aviator's helmet set atilt over
his powdered wig, and his eyes glowing like
coals through his goggles. He was waving two
lighted torches and shouting, &#8220;The British are
coming! The British are coming!&#8221; in a voice
strangely like Drew's.</p>

<h3><a name="PENGUINS" id="PENGUINS"></a>PENGUINS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> simple civilian notions as to the
amount of time necessary for dressing, Drew
and I rose with the sound of the bugle on the
following morning. We had promised each
other that we would begin our new life in true
soldier style, and so we reluctantly hurried to
the wash-house, where we shaved in cold water,
washed after a fashion, and then hurried back
to the unheated barrack-room. We felt refreshed,
morally and physically, but our heroic
example seemed to make no impression upon
our fellow aviators, whether French or American.
Indeed, not one of them stirred until ten
minutes before time for the morning <i>appel</i>,
when, there was a sudden upheaval of blankets
down the entire length of the room. It was as
though the patients in a hospital ward had been
inoculated with some wonderful, instantaneous-health-giving
virus. Men were jumping into
boots and trousers at the same time, and running
to and from the wash-house, buttoning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
their shirts and drying their faces as they ran.
It must have taken months of experiment to
perfect the system whereby every one remained
in bed until the last possible moment. They
professed to be very proud of it, but it was
clear that they felt more at ease when Drew
and I, after a week of heroic, early-morning
resolves, abandoned our daily test of courage.
We are all Doctor Johnsons at heart.</p>

<p>It was a crisp, calm morning&mdash;an excellent
day for flying. Already the mechanicians were
bringing out the machines and lining them up
in front of the hangars, in preparation for the
morning work, which began immediately after
<i>appel</i>. Drew and I had received notice that we
were to begin our training at once. Solicitous
fellow countrymen had warned us to take with
us all our flying clothes. We were by no means
to forget our goggles, and the fur-lined boots
which are worn over ordinary boots as a protection
against the cold. Innocently, we obeyed
all instructions to the letter. The absurdity of
our appearance will be appreciated only by air-men.
Novices begin their training, at a Bl&eacute;riot
monoplane school, in Penguins&mdash;low-powered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
machines with clipped wings, which are not
capable of leaving the ground. We were dressed
as we would have no occasion to be dressed until
we should be making sustained flights at high
altitudes. Every one, Frenchmen and Americans
alike, had a good laugh at our expense, but
it was one in which we joined right willingly;
and one kind-hearted <i>adjudant-moniteur</i>, in order
to remove what discomfiture we may have
felt, told us, through an interpreter, that he was
sure we would become good air-men. The <i>tr&egrave;s
bon pilote</i> could be distinguished, in embryo,
by the way he wore his goggles.</p>

<p>The beginners' class did not start work with
the others, owing to the fact that the Penguins,
driven by unaccustomed hands, covered a vast
amount of ground in their rolling sorties back
and forth across the field. Therefore Drew and
I had leisure to watch the others, and to see
in operation the entire scheme by means of
which France trains her combat pilots for the
front. Exclusive of the Penguin, there were
seven classes, graded according to their degree
of advancement. These, in their order, were
the rolling class (a second-stage Penguin class,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in which one still kept on the ground, but in
machines of higher speed); the first flying class&mdash;short
hops across the field at an altitude of
two or three metres; the second flying class,
where one learned to mount to from thirty to
fifty metres, and to make landings without the
use of the motor; <i>tour de piste</i> (<small>A</small>)&mdash;flights
about the aerodrome in a forty-five horse-power
Bl&eacute;riot; <i>tour de piste</i> (<small>B</small>)&mdash;similar flights in a
fifty horse-power machine; the spiral class, and
the brevet class.</p>

<p>Our reception committee of the day before
volunteered his services as guide, and took us
from one class to another, making comments
upon the nature of the work of each in a bewildering
combination of English and Americanized French.
I understood but little of his
explanation, although later I was able to appreciate
his French translation of some of our
breezy Americanisms. But explanation was,
for the most part, unnecessary. We could see
for ourselves how the prospective pilot advanced
from one class to another, becoming
accustomed to machines of higher and higher
power, &#8220;growing his wings&#8221; very gradually,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
until at last he reached the spiral class, where
he learned to make landings at a given spot
and without the use of his motor, from an altitude
of from eight hundred to one thousand
metres, losing height in volplanes and serpentines.
The final tests for the military brevet
were two cross-country flights of from two hundred
to three hundred kilometres, with landings
during each flight, at three points, two
short voyages of sixty kilometres each, and an
hour flight at a minimum altitude of two thousand
metres.</p>

<p>With all the activities of the school taking
place at once, we were as excited as two boys
seeing their first three-ring circus. We scarcely
knew which way to turn in our anxiety to miss
nothing. But my chief concern, in anticipation,
had been this: how were English-speaking
<i>&eacute;l&egrave;ves-pilotes</i> to overcome the linguistic handicap?
My uneasiness was set at rest on this first
morning, when I saw how neatly most of the
difficulties were overcome. Many of the Americans
had no knowledge of French other than
that which they had acquired since entering
the French service, and this, as I have already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hinted, had no great utilitarian value. An interpreter
had been provided for them through
the generosity and kindness of the Franco-American
Committee in Paris; but it was impossible
for him to be everywhere at once, and
much was left to their own quickness of understanding
and to the ingenuity of the <i>moniteurs</i>.
The latter, being French, were eloquent with
their gestures. With the additional aid of a
few English phrases which they had acquired
from the Americans, and the simplest kind of
French, they had little difficulty in making
their instructions clear. Both of us felt much
encouraged as we listened, for we could understand
them very well.</p>

<p>As for the business of flying, as we watched
it from below, it seemed the safest and simplest
thing in the world. The machines left the
ground so easily, and mounted and descended
with such sureness of movement, that I was impatient
to begin my training. I believed that
I could fly at once, after a few minutes of
preliminary instruction, without first going
through with all the tedious rolling along the
ground in low-powered machines. But before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the morning's work was finished, I revised my
opinion. Accidents began to happen, the first
one when one of the &#8220;old family cuckoos,&#8221; as
the rolling machines were disdainfully called,
showed a sudden burst of old-time speed and
left the ground in an alarming manner.</p>

<p>It was evident that the man who was driving
it, taken completely by surprise, had lost
his head, and was working the controls erratically.
First he swooped upward, then dived,
tipping dangerously on one wing. In this sudden
emergency he had quite forgotten his newly
acquired knowledge. I wondered what I would
do in such a strait, when one must think with
the quickness and sureness of instinct. My
heart was in my mouth, for I felt certain that
the man would be killed. As for the others who
were watching, no one appeared to be excited.
A <i>moniteur</i> near me said, &#8220;Oh, l&agrave; l&agrave;! Il est
perdu!&#8221; in a mild voice. The whole affair happened
so quickly that I was not able to think
myself into a similar situation before the end
had come. At the last, the machine made a
quick swoop downward, from a height of about
fifty metres, then careened upward, tipped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
again, and diving sidewise, struck the ground
with a sickening rending crash, the motor going
at full speed. For a moment it stood, tail
in air; then slowly the balance was lost, and it
fell, bottom up, and lay silent.</p>

<p>An enterprising moving-picture company
would have given a great deal of money to film
that accident. It would have provided a splendid
dramatic climax to a war drama of high
adventure. Civilian audiences would have
watched in breathless, awe-struck silence; but
at a military school of aviation it was a different
matter. &#8220;Oh, l&agrave; l&agrave;! Il est perdu!&#8221; adequately
gauges the degree of emotional interest
taken in the incident. At the time I was surprised
at this apparent callousness, but I understood
it better when I had seen scores of
such accidents occur, and had watched the pilots,
as in this case, crawl out from the wreckage,
and walk sheepishly, and a little shaken,
back to their classes. Although the machines
were usually badly wrecked, the pilots were
rarely severely hurt. The landing chassis of a
Bl&eacute;riot is so strong that it will break the force
of a very heavy fall, and the motor, being in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
front, strikes the ground first instead of pinning
the pilot beneath it.</p>

<p>To anticipate a little, in more than four
months of training at the Bl&eacute;riot school there
was not a single fatality, although as many as
eleven machines were wrecked in the course
of one working day, and rarely less than two
or three. There were so many accidents as to
convince me that Bl&eacute;riot training for novices
is a mistake from the economic point of view.
The up-keep expense is vastly greater than in
double-command biplane schools, where the
student pilot not only learns to fly in a much
more stable machine, but makes all his early
flights in company with a <i>moniteur</i> who has
his own set of controls and may immediately
correct any mistakes in handling. But France
is not guided by questions of expense in her
training of <i>pilotes de chasse</i>, and opinion appears
to be that single-command monoplane
training is to be preferred for the airman who
is to be a combat pilot. Certain it is that men
have greater confidence in themselves when
they learn to fly alone from the beginning; and
the Bl&eacute;riot, which requires the most delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and sensitive handling, offers excellent preliminary
schooling for the Nieuport and Spad, the
fast and high-powered biplanes which are the
<i>avions de chasse</i> above the French lines.</p>

<p>A spice of interest was added to the morning's
thrills when an American, not to be outdone
by his French compatriot, wrecked a machine
so completely that it seemed incredible
that he could have escaped without serious injury.
But he did, and then we witnessed the
amusing spectacle of an American, who had no
French at all, explaining through the interpreter
just how the accident had happened. I
saw his <i>moniteur</i>, who knew no English, grin in
a relieved kind of way when the American
crawled out from under the wreckage. The
reception committee whispered to me, &#8220;This
is Pourquoi, the best bawler-out we've got.
'Pourquoi?' is always his first broadside. Then
he wades in and you can hear him from one end
of the field to the other. <i>Attendez!</i> this is going
to be rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both of them started talking at once, the
<i>moniteur</i> in French and the American in English.
Then they turned to the interpreter, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
any one witnessing the conversation from a distance
would have thought that he was the culprit.
The American had left the ground with
the wind behind him, a serious fault in an
airman, and he knew it very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Pete,&#8221; he said; &#8220;tell him I know
it was my fault. Tell him I took a Steve Brody.
I wanted to see if the old cuckoo had any pep
in 'er. When I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pourquoi? Nom de Dieu! Qu'est-ce que je
vous ai dit? Jamais faire comme &ccedil;a! Jamais
monter avec le vent en arri&egrave;re! Jamais! Jamais!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others listened in hilarious silence while
the interpreter turned first to one and then to
the other. &#8220;Tell him I took a Steve Brody.&#8221; I
wondered if he translated that literally. Steve
took a chance, but it is hardly to be expected
that a Frenchman would know of that daring
gentleman's history. In this connection, I remember
a little talk on caution which was
given to us, later, by an English-speaking <i>moniteur</i>.
It was after rather a serious accident, for
which the spirit of Steve Brody was again responsible.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Americans,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the front you will get the Boche; but let me tell
you, they will kill many of you. Not one or
two; very many.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accidents delayed the work of flying scarcely
at all. As soon as a machine was wrecked, Annamites
appeared on the spot to clear away
the d&eacute;bris and take it to the repair-shops, where
the usable portions were quickly sorted out.
We followed one of these processions in, and
spent an hour watching the work of this other
department of aviation upon which our own
was so entirely dependent. Here machines were
being built as well as repaired. The air vibrated
with the hum of machinery, with the clang of
hammers upon anvils and the roar of motors
in process of being tested.</p>

<p>There was a small army of women doing work
of many kinds. They were quite apt at it, particularly
in the department where the fine
strong linen cloth which covers the wings was
being sewn together and stretched over the
framework. There were great husky peasant-women
doing the hardest kind of manual labor.
In these latter days of the great world-war,
women are doing everything, surely, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
one exception of fighting. It is not a pleasant
thing to see them, however strong they may be,
doing the rough, coarse work of men, bearing
great burdens on their backs as though they
were oxen. There must be many now whose
muscles are as hard and whose hands as horny
as those of a stevedore. Several months after
this time, when we were transferred to another
school of aviation, one of the largest in Europe,
we saw women employed on a much larger
scale. They lived in barracks which were no
better than our own,&mdash;not so good, in fact,&mdash;and
roughed it like common soldiers.</p>

<p>Toward evening the wind freshened and flying
was brought to a halt. Then the Penguins
were brought from their hangars, and Drew and
I, properly dressed this time, and accompanied
by some of the Americans, went out to the field
for our first sortie. As is usual on such occasions,
there was no dearth of advice. Every
graduate of the Penguin class had a method of
his own for keeping that unmanageable bird
traveling in a direct line, and every one was only
too willing to give us the benefit of his experience.
Finally, out of the welter of suggestions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
one or two points became clear: it was important
that one should give the machine full gas,
and get the tail off the ground. Then, by skillful
handling of the rudder, it might be kept
traveling in the same general direction. But if,
as usually happened, it showed willful tendencies,
and started to turn within its own length,
it was necessary to cut the contact, to prevent
it from whirling so rapidly as to overturn.</p>

<p>Never have I seen a stranger sight than that
of a swarm of Penguins at work. They looked
like a brood of prehistoric birds of enormous
size, with wings too short for flight. Most unwieldy
birds they were, driven by, or more accurately,
driving beginners in the art of flying;
but they ran along the ground at an amazing
speed, zigzagged this way and that, and whirled
about as if trying to catch their own tails. As
we stood watching them, an accident occurred
which would have been laughable had we not
been too nervous to enjoy it. In a distant part
of the field two machines were rushing wildly
about. There were acres of room in which
they might pass, but after a moment of uncertainty,
they rushed headlong for each other as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
though driven by the hand of fate, and met
head-on, with a great rending of propellers. The
onlookers along the side of the field howled and
pounded each other in an ecstasy of delight, but
Drew and I walked apart for a hasty consultation,
for it was our turn next. We kept rehearsing
the points which we were to remember in
driving a Penguin: full gas and tail up at once.
Through the interpreter, our <i>moniteur</i> explained
very carefully what we were to do, and mounted
the step, to show us, in turn, the proper handling
of the gas <i>manet</i> and of the <i>coupe-contact</i>
button. Then he stepped down and shouted,
&#8220;Allez! en route!&#8221; with a smile meant to be reassuring.</p>

<p>I buckled myself in, fastened my helmet, and
nodded to my mechanic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coupe, plein gaz,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coupe, plein gaz,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>He gave the propeller a few spins to suck in
the mixture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Contact, reduisez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contact, reduisez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he spun the propeller, and the motor
took. I pulled back my <i>manet</i>, full gas, and off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I went at what seemed to me then breakneck
speed. Remembering instructions, I pushed
forward on the lever which governs the elevating
planes, and up went my tail so quickly and
at such an angle that almost instinctively I cut
off my contact. Down dropped my tail again,
and I whirled round in a circle&mdash;my first
<i>cheval de bois</i>, as this absurd-looking man&oelig;uvre
is called. I had forgotten that I had a rudder.
I was like a man learning to swim, and could
not yet co&ouml;rdinate the movements of my hands
and feet. My bird was purring gently, with the
propeller turning slowly. It seemed thoroughly
domesticated, but I knew that I had but to
pull back on that <i>manet</i> to transform it into a
rampant bird of prey. Before starting again I
looked about me, and there was Drew racing all
over the field. Suddenly he started in my direction
as if the whole force of his will was
turned to the business of running me down.
Luckily he shut off his motor, and by the grace
of the law of inertia came to a halt when he was
within a dozen paces of me.</p>

<p>We turned our machines tail to tail and
started off in opposite directions, but in a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I was following hard after him. Almost
it seemed that those evil birds had wills of their
own. Drew's turned as though it were angry
at the indignity of being pursued. We missed
each other, but it was a near thing, and, not
being able to think fast enough, I stalled my
motor, and had to await helplessly the assistance
of a mechanic. Far away, at our starting-point,
I could see the Americans waving their
arms and embracing each other in huge delight,
and then I realized why they had all been so
eager to come with us to the field. They had
been through all this. Now they were having
their innings. I could hear them shouting, although
their voices sounded very thin and faint.
&#8220;Why don't you come back?&#8221; they yelled.
&#8220;This way! Here we are! Here's your class!&#8221;
They were having the time of their vindictive
lives, and knew very well that we would go
back if we could.</p>

<p>Finally we began to get the hang of it, and
we did go back, although by circuitous routes.
But we got there, and the <i>moniteur</i> explained
again what we were to do. We were to anticipate
the turn of the machine with the rudder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
just as in sailing a boat. Then we understood
the difficulty. In my next sortie, I fixed my
eye upon the flag at the opposite side of the
field, and reached it without a single <i>cheval de
bois</i>. I could have kissed the Annamite who
was stationed there to turn the machines which
rarely came. I had mastered the Penguin! I
had forced my will upon it, compelled it to do
my bidding! Back across the field I went,
keeping a direct course, and thinking how they
were all watching, the <i>moniteur</i>, doubtless, making
approving comments. I reduced the gas at
the proper time, and taxied triumphantly up
to the starting-point.</p>

<p>But no one had seen my splendid sortie.
Now that I had arrived, no one paid the least
attention to me. All eyes were turned upward,
and following them with my own, I saw an
airplane outlined against a heaped-up pile of
snow-white cloud. It was moving at tremendous
speed, when suddenly it darted straight
upward, wavered for a second or two, turned
slowly on one wing and fell, nose-down, turning
round and round as it fell, like a scrap of
paper. It was the <i>vrille</i>, the prettiest piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
aerial acrobatics that one could wish to see. It
was a wonderful, an incredible sight. Only
seven years ago Bl&eacute;riot crossed the English
Channel, and a year earlier the world was astonished
at the exploits of the Wright brothers,
who were making flights, straight-line flights,
of from fifteen to twenty minutes' duration!</p>

<p>Some one was counting the turns of the <i>vrille</i>.
Six, seven, eight; then the airman came out of
it on an even keel, and, nosing down to gather
speed, looped twice in quick succession. Afterward
he did the <i>retournement</i>, turning completely
over in the air and going back in the opposite
direction; then spiraled down and passed
over our heads at about fifty metres, landing
at the opposite side of the field so beautifully
that it was impossible to know when the machine
touched the ground. The airman taxied
back to the hangars and stopped just in front
of us, while we gathered round to hear the latest
news from the front.</p>

<p>For he had left the front, this birdman, only
an hour before! I was incredulous at first, for
I still thought of distances in the old way. But
I was soon convinced. Mounted on the hood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was the competent-looking Vickers machine
gun, with a long belt of cartridges in place, and
on the side of the <i>fuselage</i> were painted the insignia
of an escadrille.</p>

<p>The pilot was recognized as soon as he removed
his helmet and goggles. He had been
a <i>moniteur</i> at the school in former days, and was
well known to some of the older Americans. He
greeted us all very cordially, in excellent English,
and told us how, on the strength of a hard
morning's work over the lines, he had asked his
captain for an afternoon off that he might visit
his old friends at B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>As soon as he had climbed down, those of us
who had never before seen this latest type of
French <i>avion de chasse</i>, crowded round, examining
and admiring with feelings of awe and reverence.
It was a marvelous piece of aero-craftsmanship,
the result of more than two years of
accumulating experience in military aviation.
It was hard to think of it as an inanimate thing,
once having seen it in the air. It seemed living,
intelligent, almost human. I could readily understand
how it is that airmen become attached
to their machines and speak of their fine points,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
their little peculiarities of individuality, with
a kind of loving interest, as one might speak of
a fine-spirited horse.</p>

<p>While the mechanicians were grooming this
one, and replenishing the fuel-tanks, Drew and
I examined it line by line, talking in low tones
which seemed fitting in so splendid a presence.
We climbed the step and looked down into the
compact little car, where the pilot sat in a luxuriously
upholstered seat. There were his compass,
his <i>altim&eacute;tre</i>, his revolution-counter, his
map in its roller case, with a course pricked out
on it in a red line. Attached to the machine
gun, there was an ingenious contrivance by
means of which he fired it while still keeping a
steady hand on his controls. The gun itself was
fired directly through the propeller by means
of a device which timed the shots. The necessity
for accuracy in this timing device is clear,
when one remembers that the propeller turns
over at a normal rate of between fifteen hundred
and nineteen hundred revolutions per
minute.</p>

<p>It was with a chastened spirit that I looked
from this splendid fighting 'plane, back to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
little three-cylinder Penguin, with its absurd
clipped wings and its impudent tail. A moment
ago it had seemed a thing of speed, and the
mastery of it a glorious achievement. I told
Drew what my feeling was as I came racing
back to the starting-point, and how brief my
moment of triumph had been. He answered
me at first in grunts and nods, so that I knew
he was not listening. Presently he began to
talk about romance again, the &#8220;romance of
high adventure,&#8221; as he called it. &#8220;All this&#8221;&mdash;moving
his arm in a wide gesture&mdash;was but an
evidence of man's unconquerable craving for
romance. War itself was a manifestation of it,
gave it scope, relieved the pent-up longings for
it which could not find sufficient outlet in times
of peace. Romance would always be one of the
minor, and sometimes one of the major causes
for war, indirectly of course, but none the less
really; for the craving for it was one reason why
millions of men so readily accepted war at the
hands of the little groups of diplomats who
ruled their destinies.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as we stood watching the
little biplane again climbing into the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sky, I understood, in a way, what he was driving
at, and with what keen anticipation he was
looking forward to the time when we too would
know all that there was to know of the joy of
flight. Higher and higher it mounted, now and
then catching the sun on its silver wings in a
flash of light, growing smaller and smaller, until
it vanished in a golden haze, far to the north.
It was then four o'clock. In an hour's time the
pilot would be circling down over his aerodrome
on the Champagne front.</p>

<h3><a name="BY_THE_ROUTE_OF_THE_AIR" id="BY_THE_ROUTE_OF_THE_AIR"></a>BY THE ROUTE OF THE AIR</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter of 1916-17 was the most prolonged
and bitter that France has known in many
years. It was a trying period to the little group
of Americans assembled at the &Eacute;cole Militaire
d'Aviation, eager as they were to complete their
training, and to be ready, when spring should
come, to share in the great offensive, which
they knew would then take place on the Western
front. Aviation is a waiting game at the
best of seasons. In winter it is a series of seemingly
endless delays. Day after day, the plain
on the high plateau overlooking the old city of
V&mdash;&mdash; was storm-swept, a forlorn and desolate
place as we looked at it from our windows,
watching the flocks of crows as they beat up
against the wind, or as they turned, and were
swept with it, over our barracks, crying and
calling derisively to us as they passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Birdmen do you call yourselves?&#8221; they
seemed to say. &#8220;Then come on up; the weather's
fine!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Well they knew that we were impostors,
fair-weather fliers, who dared not accept their
challenge.</p>

<p>It is strange how vague and shadowy my
remembrance is of those long weeks of inactivity,
when we were dependent for employment
and amusement on our own devices. To me
there was a quality of unreality about our life
at B&mdash;&mdash;. Our environment was, no doubt,
partly responsible for this feeling. Although we
were not far distant from Paris,&mdash;less than an
hour by train,&mdash;the country round about our
camp seemed to be quite cut off from the rest
of the world. With the exception of our Sunday
afternoons of leave, when we joined the
<i>boulevardiers</i> in town, we lived a life as remote
and cloistered as that of some brotherhood of
monks in an inaccessible monastery. That is
how it appeared to me, although here again I
am in danger of making it seem that my own
impressions were those of all the others. This
of course was not true. The spirit of the place
appealed to us, individually, in widely different
ways, and upon some, perhaps, it had no effect
at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes we spent our winter afternoons of
enforced leisure in long walks through country
roads which lay empty to the eye for miles.
They gave one a sense of loneliness which colored
thought, not in any sentimental way, but
in a manner very natural and real. The war was
always in the background of one's musings, and
while we were far removed from actual contact
with it, every depopulated country village
brought to mind the sacrifice which France has
made for the cause of all freedom-loving nations.
Every roadside caf&eacute;, long barren of its
old patronage, was an evidence of the completeness
of the sacrifice. Americans, for the
most part, are of an unconquerably healthy
cast of mind; but there were few of us who could
frequent these places light-heartedly.</p>

<p>Paris was our emotional storehouse, to use
Kipling's term, during the time we were at
B&mdash;&mdash;. We spent our Sunday afternoons there,
mingling with the crowds on the boulevards,
or, in pleasant weather, sitting outside the
caf&eacute;s, watching the soldiers of the world go by.
The streets were filled with <i>permissionnaires</i>
from all parts of the Western front, and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
were many of those despised of all the rest, the
<i>embusqu&eacute;s</i>, as they are called, who hold the
comfortable billets in safe places well back of
the lines. It was very easy to distinguish them
from the men newly arrived from the trenches,
in whose eyes one saw the look of wonder, almost
of unbelief, that there was still a goodly
world to be enjoyed. It was often beyond the
pathetic to see them trying to satisfy their need
for all the wholesome things of life in a brief
seven days of leave; to see the family parties
at the modest restaurants on the side streets,
making merry in a kind of forced way, as if
every one were thinking of the brevity of the
time for such enjoyment.</p>

<p>Scarcely a week went by without bringing
one or two additional recruits to the Franco-American
Corps. We wondered why they came
so slowly. There must have been thousands of
Americans who would have been, not only willing,
but glad to join us; and yet the opportunities
for doing so had been made widely known.
For those who did come this was the legitimate
by-product of glorious adventure and a training
in aviation not to be surpassed in Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
This was to be had by any healthy young
American, almost for the asking; but our numbers
increased very gradually, from fifteen to
twenty-five, until by the spring of 1917 there
were fifty of us at the various aviation schools
of France. Territorially we represented at least
a dozen states, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
There were rich men's sons and poor men's sons
among our number; the sons of very old families,
and those who neither knew nor cared
what their antecedents were.</p>

<p>The same was true of our French comrades,
for membership in the French air service is not
based upon wealth or family position or political
influence. The policy of the Government is
as broad and democratic as may be. Men are
chosen because of an aptitude that promises
well, or as a reward for distinguished service
at the front. A few of the French <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ves-pilotes</i>
had been officers, but most of them N.C.O.'s
and private soldiers in infantry or artillery
regiments. This very wide latitude in choice
at first seemed &#8220;laxitude&#8221; to some of us
Americans. But evidently, experience in training
war pilots, and the practical results obtained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
by these men at the front, have been
proof enough to the French authorities of the
folly of setting rigid standards, making hard-and-fast
rules to be met by prospective aviators.
As our own experience increased, we saw
the wisdom of a policy which is more concerned
with a man's courage, his self-reliance, and his
powers of initiative, than with his ability to
work out theoretical problems in aerodynamics.</p>

<p>There are many French pilots with excellent
records of achievement in war-flying who have
but a sketchy knowledge of motor and aircraft
construction. Some are college-bred men, but
many more have only a common-school education.
It is not at all strange that this should be
the case, for one may have had no technical
training worth mentioning; one may have only
a casual speaking acquaintance with motors,
and a very imperfect idea of why and how one
is able to defy the law of gravity, and yet prove
his worth as a pilot in what is, after all, the best
possible way&mdash;by his record at the front.</p>

<p>A judicious amount of theoretical instruction
is, of course, not wanting in the aviation schools
of France; but its importance is not exaggerated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
We Americans, with our imperfect knowledge
of the language, lost the greater part of this.
The handicap was not a serious one, and I
think I may truthfully say that we kept pace
with our French comrades. The most important
thing was to gain actual flying experience,
and as much of it as possible. Only in this way
can one acquire a sensitive ear for motors, and
an accurate sense of flying speed: the feel of
one's machine in the air. These are of the greatest
importance. Once the pilot has developed
this airman's sixth sense, he need not, and
never does, worry about the scantiness of his
knowledge of the theory of flight.</p>

<p>Sometimes the winds would die away and the
thick clouds lift, and we would go joyously to
work on a morning of crisp, bright winter
weather. Then we had moments of glorious
revenge upon the crows. They would watch
us from afar, holding noisy indignation meetings
in a row of weather-beaten trees at the far
side of the field. And when some inexperienced
pilot lost control of his machine and came
crashing to earth, they would take the air in a
body, circling over the wreckage, cawing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
jeering with the most evident delight. &#8220;The
Oriental Wrecking Company,&#8221; as the Annamites
were called, were on the scene almost as
quickly as our enemies the crows. They were
a familiar sight on every working day, chattering
together in their high-pitched gutturals,
as they hauled away the wrecked machines.
They appeared to side with the birds, and must
have thought us the most absurd of men, making
wings for ourselves, and always coming to
grief when we tried to use them.</p>

<p>We made progress regardless of all this skepticism.
It was necessarily slow, for beginners
at a single-command monoplane school are permitted
to fly only under the most favorable
weather conditions. Even then, old Mother
Earth, who is not kindly disposed toward those
of her children who leave her so jauntily, would
clutch us back to her bosom, whenever we gave
her the slightest opportunity, with an embrace
that was anything but tender. We were inclined
to think rather highly of our own courage
in defying her; and sometimes our vanity
was increased by our <i>moniteurs</i>. After an exciting
misadventure they often gave expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to their relief at finding an amateur pilot
still whole, by praising his &#8220;presence of mind&#8221;
in too generous French fashion.</p>

<p>We should not have been so proud, I think,
of our own little exploits, had we remembered
those of the pioneers in aviation, so many of
whom lost their lives in experiment with the
first crude types of the heavier-than-air machines.
They were pioneers in the fine and
splendid meaning of the word&mdash;men to be
compared in spirit with the old fifteenth-century
navigators. We were but followers, adventuring,
in comparative safety, along a well-defined
trail.</p>

<p>This, at any rate, was Drew's opinion. He
would never allow me the pleasure of indulging
in any flights of fancy over these trivial adventures
of ours. He would never let me set them
off against &#8220;the heroic background&#8221; of Paris.
As for Paris, we saw nothing of war there, he
would say, except the lighter side, the homecoming,
leave-enjoying side. We needed to
know more of the horror and the tragedy of it.
We needed to keep that close and intimate to
us as a right perspective for our future adventures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
He believed it to be our duty as aviators
to anticipate every kind of experience which
we might have to meet at the front. His imagination
was abnormally vivid. Once he discussed
the possibility of &#8220;falling in flames,&#8221;
which is so often the end of an airman's career.
I shall never again be able to take the same
whole-hearted delight in flying that I did before
he was so horribly eloquent upon the subject.
He often speculated upon one's emotions in
falling in a machine damaged beyond the possibility
of control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now try to imagine it,&#8221; he would say:
&#8220;your gasoline tanks have been punctured and
half of your <i>fuselage</i> has been shot away. You
believe that there is not the slightest chance
for you to save your life. What are you going
to do&mdash;lose your head and give up the game?
No, you've got to attempt the impossible&#8221;;
and so on, and so forth.</p>

<p>I would accuse him of being morbid. Furthermore,
I saw no reason why we should plan for
terrible emergencies which might never arrive.
His answer was that we were military pilots in
training for combat machines. We had no right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to ignore the grimness of the business ahead of
us. If we did, so much the worse for us when we
should go to the front. But beyond this practical
interest, he had a great curiosity about
the nature of fear, and a great dread of it, too.
He was afraid that in some last adventure, in
which death came slowly enough for him to
recognize it, he might die like a terror-stricken
animal, and not bravely, as a man should.</p>

<p>We did not often discuss these gruesome possibilities,
although this was not Drew's fault.
I would not listen to him; and so he would
be silent about them until convinced that the
furtherance of our careers as airmen demanded
additional unpleasant imaginings. There was
something of the Hindoo fanatic in him; or perhaps
it was the outcropping of the stern spirit
of his New England forbears. But when he
talked of the pleasant side of the adventures
before us, it was more than compensation for
all the rest. Then he would make me restless
and impatient, for I did not have his faculty of
enjoyment in anticipation. The early period of
training, when we were flying only a few metres
above the ground, seemed endless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>At last came the event which really marked
the beginning of our careers as airmen: the first
<i>tour de piste</i>, the first flight round the aerodrome.
We had talked of this for weeks, but
when at last the day for it came, our enthusiasm
had waned. We were eager to try our wings
and yet afraid to make the start.</p>

<p>This first <i>tour de piste</i> was always the occasion
for a gathering of the Americans, and
there was the usual assembly present. The
beginners were there to shiver in anticipation
of their own forthcoming trials, and the more
advanced pilots, who had already taken the
leap, to offer gratuitous advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don't try to pull any big league stuff.
Not too much rudder on the turns. Remember
how that Frenchman piled up on the Farman
hangars when he tried to bank the corners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll find it pretty rotten when you go
over the woods. The air currents there are
something scandalous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, it's a lot worse over the fort.
Rough? Oh, l&agrave; l&agrave;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that's where you have to cut your
motor and dive, if you're going to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
landing without hanging up in the telephone
wires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you do come down, don't be afraid
to stick her nose forward. Scare the life out of
you, that drop will, but you may as well get
used to it in the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But wait till we see them redress! Where's
the Oriental Wrecking Gang?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't let that worry you, Drew: pan-caking
isn't too bad. Not in a Bl&eacute;riot. Just like
falling through a shingle roof. Can't hurt yourself
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do spill, make it a good one. There
hasn't been a decent smash-up to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were the usual comforting assurances.
They did not frighten us much, although there
was just enough truth in the warnings to make
us uneasy. We took our hazing as well as we
could inwardly, and of course with imperturbable
calm outwardly; but, to make a confession,
I was somewhat reluctant to hear the businesslike
&#8220;Allez! en route!&#8221; of our <i>moniteur</i>.</p>

<p>When it came, I taxied across to the other
side of the field, turned into the wind, and came
racing back, full motor. It seemed a thing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tremendous power, that little forty-five-horsepower
Anzani. The roar of it struck awe into
my soul, and I gripped the controls in no very
professional manner. Then, when I had gathered
full ground speed, I eased her off gently,
and up we went, over the class and the assembled
visitors, above the hangars, the lake, the
forest, until, at the halfway point, my altimetre
registered three hundred and fifty metres.
Out of the corner of my eye I saw all the beautiful
countryside spread out beneath me, but
I was too busily occupied to take in the prospect.
I was watching my wings, nervously, in
order to anticipate and counteract the slightest
pitch of the machine. But nothing happened,
and I soon realized that this first grand tour
was not going to be nearly so bad as we had
been led to believe. I began to enjoy it. I even
looked down over the side of the <i>fuselage</i>, although
it was a very hasty glance.</p>

<p>All the time I was thinking of the rapidly approaching
moment when I should have to come
down. I knew well enough how the descent was
to be made. It was very simple. I had only to
shut off my motor, push forward with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
&#8220;broom-stick,&#8221;&mdash;the control connected with
the elevating planes,&mdash;and then wait and
redress gradually, beginning at from six to
eight metres from the ground. The descent
would be exciting, a little more rapid than
Shooting the Chutes. Only one could not safely
hold on to the sides of the car and await the
splash. That sort of thing had sometimes been
done in aeroplanes, by over-excited pilots. The
results were disastrous, without exception.</p>

<p>The moment for the decision came. I was
above the fort, otherwise I should not have
known when to dive. At first the sensation was,
I imagine, exactly that of falling, feet foremost;
but after pulling back slightly on the controls,
I felt the machine answer to them, and the uncomfortable
feeling passed. I brought up on
the ground in the usual bumpy manner of the
beginner. Nothing gave way, however, so this
did not spoil the fine rapture of a rare moment.
It was shared&mdash;at least it was pleasant to
think so&mdash;by my old Annamite friend of the
Penguin experience, who stood by his flag nodding
his head at me. He said, &#8220;Beaucoup bon,&#8221;
showing his polished black teeth in an approving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
grin. I forgot for the moment that &#8220;beaucoup
bon&#8221; was his enigmatical comment upon
all occasions, and that he would have grinned
just as broadly had he been dragging me out
from a mass of wreckage.</p>

<p>Drew came in a few moments later, making
an almost perfect landing. In the evening we
walked to a neighboring village, where we had
a wonderful dinner to celebrate the end of our
apprenticeship. It was a curious feast. We
had little to say to one another, or, better, we
were both afraid to talk. We were under an
enchantment which words would have broken.
After a silent meal, we walked all the way home
without speaking.</p>

<p>We started off together on our triangles.
That was in April, just passed, so that I have
now brought this casual diary almost up to
date. We were then at the great school of
aviation at A&mdash;&mdash; in central France, where, for
the first time, we were associated with men in
training for every branch of aviation service,
and became familiar with other types of French
machines. But the brevet tests, which every
pilot must pass before he becomes a military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
aviator, were the same in every department of
the school. The triangles were two cross-country
flights of two hundred kilometres each,
three landings to be made <i>en route</i>, and each
flight to be completed within forty-eight hours.
In addition, there were two short voyages of
sixty kilometres each&mdash;these preceded the
triangular tests&mdash;and an hour of flight at a
minimum altitude of sixty-five hundred feet.</p>

<p>The short voyages gave us a delightful foretaste
of what was to come. We did them both
one afternoon, and were at the hangars at five
o'clock on the following morning, ready to
make an early start. A fresh wind was blowing
from the northeast, but the brevet <i>moniteur</i>,
who went up for a short flight to try the air,
came back with the information that it was
quite calm at twenty-five hundred feet. We
might start, he said, as soon as we liked.</p>

<p>Drew, in his joy, embraced the old woman
who kept a coffee-stall at the hangars, while I
danced a one-step with a mechanician. Neither
of them was surprised at this procedure. They
were accustomed to such emotional outbursts
on the part of aviators who, by the very nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of their calling, were always in the depths
of despair or on the farthest jutting peak of
some mountain of delight. Our departure had
been delayed, day after day, for more than a
week, because of the weather. We were so eager
to start that we would willingly have gone off
in a blizzard.</p>

<p>During the week of waiting we had studied
our map until we knew the location of every
important road and railroad, every forest, river,
canal, and creek within a radius of one hundred
kilometres. We studied it at close range, on a
table, and then on the floor, with the compass-points
properly orientated, so that we might see
all the important landmarks with the birdman's
eye. We knew our course so well, that there
seemed no possibility of our losing direction.</p>

<p>Our military papers had been given us several
days before. Among these was an official-looking
document to be presented to the mayor
of any town or village near which we might be
compelled to land. It contained an extract from
the law concerning aviators, and the duty toward
them of the civilian and military authorities.
In another was an itemized list of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
amounts which might be exacted by farmers for
damage to growing crops: so much for an <i>atterrissage</i>
in a field of sugar-beets, so much for
wheat, etc. Besides these, we had a book of
detailed instructions as to our duty in case of
emergencies of every conceivable kind&mdash;among
others, the course of action to be followed if we
should be compelled to land in an enemy country.
At first sight this seemed an unnecessary
precaution; but we remembered the experience
of one of our French comrades at B&mdash;&mdash;, who
started confidently off on his first cross-country
flight. He lost his way and did not realize
how far astray he had gone until he found himself
under fire from German anti-aircraft batteries
on the Belgian front.</p>

<p>The most interesting paper of all was our <i>Ordre
de Service</i>, the text of which was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is commanded that the bearer of this Order
report himself at the cities of C&mdash;&mdash; and R&mdash;&mdash;,
by the route of the air, flying an avion Caudron,
and leaving the &Eacute;cole Militaire d'Aviation at
A&mdash;&mdash; on the 21st of April, 1917, without passenger
on board.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em">Signed, <span class="smcap">Le Capitaine B&mdash;&mdash;</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em">Commandant de l'&Eacute;cole.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We read this with feelings which must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
been nearly akin to those of Columbus on a
memorable day in 1492 when he received his
clearance papers from Cadiz. &#8220;By the route of
the air!&#8221; How the imagination lingered over
that phrase! We had the better of Columbus
there, although we had to admit that there was
more glamour in the hazard of his adventure
and the uncertainty of his destination.</p>

<p>Drew was ready first. I helped him into his
fur-lined combination and strapped him to his
seat. A moment later he was off. I watched
him as he gathered height over the aerodrome.
Then, finding that his motor was running satisfactorily,
he struck out in an easterly direction,
his machine growing smaller and smaller until
it vanished in the early morning haze. I followed
immediately afterward, and had a busy
ten minutes, being buffeted this way and
that, until, as the brevet <i>moniteur</i> had foretold,
I reached quiet air at twenty-five hundred
feet.</p>

<p>This was my first experience in passing from
one air current to another. It was a unique
one, for I was still a little incredulous. I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
not entirely lost my old boyhood belief that the
wind went all the way up.</p>

<p>I passed over the old cathedral town of B&mdash;&mdash;
at fifteen hundred metres. Many a pleasant
afternoon had we spent there, walking through
its narrow, crooked streets, or lounging on the
banks of the canal. The cathedral too was a
favorite haunt. I loved the fine spaciousness
of it. Looking down on it now, it seemed no
larger than a toy cathedral in a toy town, such
as one sees in the shops of Paris. The streets
were empty, for it was not yet seven o'clock.
Strips of shadow crossed them where taller
roofs cut off the sunshine. A toy train, which I
could have put nicely into my fountain-pen
case, was pulling into a station no larger than
a wren's house. The Greeks called their gods
&#8220;derisive.&#8221; No doubt they realized how small
they looked to them, and how insignificant this
little world of affairs must have appeared from
high Olympus.</p>

<p>There was a road, a fine straight thoroughfare
converging from the left. It led almost due
southwest. This was my route to C&mdash;&mdash;. I followed
it, climbing steadily until I was at two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thousand metres. I had never flown so high
before. &#8220;Over a mile!&#8221; I thought. It seemed
a tremendous altitude. I could see scores of
villages and fine old ch&acirc;teaux, and great
stretches of forest, and miles upon miles of
open country in checkered patterns, just beginning
to show the first fresh green of the early
spring crops. It looked like a world planned and
laid out by the best of Santa Clauses for the
eternal delight of all good children. And for
untold generations only the birds have had the
privilege of seeing and enjoying it from the
wing. Small wonder that they sing. As for
non-musical birds&mdash;well, they all sing after
a fashion, and there is no doubt that crows, at
least, are extremely jealous of their prerogative
of flight.</p>

<p>My biplane was flying itself. I had nothing
to do other than to give occasional attention
to the revolution counter, altimetre, and speed-dial.
The motor was running with perfect regularity.
The propeller was turning over at
twelve hundred revolutions per minute without
the slightest fluctuation. Flying is the simplest
thing in the world, I thought. Why doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
every one travel by route of the air? If people
knew the joy of it, the exhilaration of it, aviation
schools would be overwhelmed with applicants.
Biplanes of the Farman and Voisin
type would make excellent family cars, quite
safe for women to drive. Mothers, busy with
household affairs, could tell their children to
&#8220;run out and fly&#8221; a Caudron such as I was
driving, and feel not the slightest anxiety about
them. I remembered an imaginative drawing I
had once seen of aerial activity in 1950. Even
house pets were granted the privilege of traveling
by the air route. The artist was not far
wrong except in his date. He should have put
it at 1925. On a fine April morning there
seemed no limit to the realization of such interesting
possibilities.</p>

<p>I had no more than started on my southwest
course, as it seemed to me, when I saw the
spires and the red-roofed houses of C&mdash;&mdash;, and,
a kilometre or so from the outskirts, the barracks
and hangars of the aviation school where
I was to make the first landing. I reduced the
gas, and, with the motor purring gently, began
a long, gradual descent. It was interesting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
watch the change in the appearance of the
country beneath me as I lost height. Checkerboard
patterns of brown and green grew larger
and larger. Shining threads of silver became
rivers and canals, tiny green shrubs became
trees, individual aspects of houses emerged.
Soon I could see people going about the streets
and laundry-maids hanging out the family
washing in the back gardens. I even came low
enough to witness a minor household tragedy&mdash;a
mother vigorously spanking a small boy.
Hearing the whir of my motor, she stopped in
the midst of the process, whereupon the youngster
very naturally took advantage of his opportunity
to cut and run for it. Drew doubted
my veracity when I told him about this. He
called me an aerial eavesdropper and said that
I ought to be ashamed to go buzzing over towns
at such low altitudes, frightening housemaids,
disorganizing domestic penal institutions, and
generally disturbing the privacy of respectable
French citizens. But I was unrepentant, for I
knew that one small boy in France was thinking
of me with joy. To have escaped maternal justice
with the assistance of an aviator would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
an event of glorious memory to him. How
vastly more worth while such a method of escape,
and how jubilant Tom Sawyer would
have been over such an opportunity when his
horrified warning, &#8220;Look behind you, aunt!&#8221;
had lost efficacy.</p>

<p>Drew had been waiting a quarter of an hour,
and came rushing out to meet me as I taxied
across the field. We shook hands as though we
had not seen each other for years. We could
not have been more surprised and delighted if
we had met on another planet after long and
hopeless wanderings in space.</p>

<p>While I superintended the replenishing of
my fuel and oil tanks he walked excitedly up
and down in front of the hangars. He was an
odd-looking sight in his flying clothes, with a
pair of Meyrowitz goggles set back on his head,
like another set of eyes, gazing at the sky with
an air of wide astonishment. He paid no attention
to my critical comments, but started thinking
aloud as soon as I rejoined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was lonely! Yes, by Jove! that was it.
A glorious thing, one's isolation up there; but it
was too profound to be pleasant. A relief to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
down again, to hear people talk, to feel the solid
earth under one's feet. How did it impress you?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was like Drew. I felt ashamed of the
lightness of my own thoughts, but I had to
tell him of my speculations upon after-the-war
developments in aviation: nurses flying Voisins,
with the cars filled with babies; old men
having after-dinner naps in twenty-three-metre
Nieuports, fitted, for safety, with Sperry
gyroscopes; family parties taking comfortable
outings in gigantic biplanes of the R-6 type;
mothers, as of old, gazing apprehensively at
speed-dials, cautioning fathers about &#8220;driving
too fast,&#8221; and all of the rest.</p>

<p>Drew looked at me reprovingly, to be sure,
but he felt the need, just as I did, of an outlet
to his feelings, and so he turned to this kind of
comic relief with the most delightful reluctance.
He quickly lost his reserve, and in the imaginative
spree which followed we went far beyond
the last outposts of absurdity. We laughed over
our own wit until our faces were tired. However,
I will not be explicit about our folly. It
might not be so amusing from a critical point of
view.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>After our papers have been vis&eacute;ed at the office
of the commandant, we hurried back to our
machines, eager to be away again. We were to
make our second landing at R&mdash;&mdash;. It was
about seventy kilometres distant and almost
due north. The mere name of the town was an
invitation. Somewhere, in one of the novels of
William J. Locke, may be found this bit of
dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, master,&#8221; said I, &#8220;there is, after all,
color in words. Don't you remember how delighted
you were with the name of a little town
we passed through on the way to Orleans?
R&mdash;&mdash;? You were haunted by it and said it was
like the purple note of an organ.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were haunted by it, too, for we were going
to that very town. We would see it long before
our arrival&mdash;a cluster of quaint old houses
lying in the midst of pleasant fields, with roads
curving toward it from the north and south,
as though they were glad to pass through so
delightful a place. Drew was for taking a leisurely
route to the eastward, so that we might
look at some villages which lay some distance
off our course. I wanted to fly by compass in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a direct line, without following my map very
closely. We had planned to fly together, and
were the more eager to do this because of an
argument we had had about the relative speed
of our machines. He was certain that his was
the faster. I knew that, with mine, I could fly
circles around him. As we were not able to
agree on the course, we decided to postpone the
race until we started on the homeward journey.
Therefore, after we had passed over the town,
he waved his hand, bent off to the northeast,
and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>I kept straight on, climbing steadily, until
I was again at five thousand feet. As before, my
motor was running perfectly and I had plenty
of leisure to enjoy the always new sensation of
flight and to watch the wide expanse of magnificent
country as it moved slowly past. I let my
mind lie fallow, and every now and then I
would find it hauling out fragments of old
memories which I had forgotten that I possessed.</p>

<p>I recalled, for the first time in many years,
my earliest interpretations of the meanings of
all the phenomena of the heavens. Two old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
janitor saints had charge of the floor of the
skies. One of them was a jolly old man who
liked boys, and always kept the sky swept
clean and blue. The other took a sour delight
in shirking his duties, so that it might rain and
spoil all our fun. Perhaps it was Drew's sense
of loneliness and helplessness so far from earth,
which made me think of winds and clouds in
friendly human terms. However that may be,
these reveries, hardly worthy of a military airman,
were abruptly broken into.</p>

<p>All at once, I realized that, while my biplane
was headed due north, I was drifting north and
west. This seemed strange. I puzzled over it
for some time, and then, brilliantly, in the manner
of the novice, deduced the reason: wind.
I was being blown off my course, all the while
comfortably certain that I was flying in a direct
line toward R&mdash;&mdash;. Our <i>moniteurs</i> had
often cautioned us against being comfortably
certain about anything while in the air. It was
our duty to be uncomfortably alert. Wind! I
wonder how many times we had been told to
keep it in mind at all times, whether on the
ground or in the air? And here was I forgetting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the existence of wind on the very first occasion.
The speed of my machine and the current
of air from the propeller had deceived
me into thinking that I was driving dead into
whatever breeze there was at that altitude. I
discovered that it was blowing out of the east,
therefore I headed a quarter into it, to overcome
the drift, and looked for landmarks.</p>

<p>I had not long to search. Wisps of mist obstructed
the view, and within ten minutes a
bank of solid cloud cut it off completely. I had
only a vague notion of my location with reference
to my course, but I could not persuade
myself to come down just then. To be flying
in the full splendor of bright April sunshine,
knowing that all the earth was in shadow, gave
me a feeling of exhilaration. For there is no
sensation like that of flight, no isolation so
complete as that of the airman who has above
him only the blue sky, and below, a level floor
of pure white cloud, stretching in an unbroken
expanse toward every horizon. And so I kept
my machine headed northeast, that I might
regain the ground lost before I discovered the
drift northwest. I had made a rough calculation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the time required to cover the seventy
kilometres to R&mdash;&mdash; at the speed at which I
was traveling. The rest I left to Chance, the
godfather of all adventurers.</p>

<p>He took the initiative, as he so frequently
does with aviators who, in moments of calm
weather, are inclined to forget that they are
still children of earth. The floor of dazzling
white cloud was broken and tumbled into
heaped-up masses which came drifting by at
various altitudes. They were scattered at first
and offered splendid opportunities for aerial
steeplechasing. Then, almost before I was
aware of it, they surrounded me on all sides.
For a few minutes I avoided them by flying in
curves and circles in rapidly vanishing pools of
blue sky. I feared to take my first plunge into
a cloud, for I knew, by report, what an alarming
experience it is to the new pilot.</p>

<p>The wind was no longer blowing steadily out
of the east. It came in gusts from all points of
the compass. I made a hasty revision of my
opinion as to the calm and tranquil joys of
aviation, thinking what fools men are who willingly
leave the good green earth and trust themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to all the winds of heaven in a frail box
of cloth-covered sticks.</p>

<p>The last clear space grew smaller and smaller.
I searched for an outlet, but the clouds closed
in and in a moment I was hopelessly lost in a
blanket of cold drenching mist.</p>

<p>I could hardly see the outlines of my machine
and had no idea of my position with reference
to the earth. In the excitement of this new adventure
I forgot the speed-dial, and it was not
until I heard the air screaming through the
wires that I remembered it. The indicator had
leaped up fifty kilometres an hour above safety
speed, and I realized that I must be traveling
earthward at a terrific pace. The manner of
the descent became clear at the same moment.
As I rolled out of the cloud-bank, I saw the
earth jauntily tilted up on one rim, looking like
a gigantic enlargement of a page out of Peter
Newell's &#8220;Slant Book.&#8221; I expected to see dogs
and dishpans, baby carriages and ash-barrels
roll out of every house in France, and go clattering
off into space.</p>

<h3><a name="AT_GDE" id="AT_GDE"></a>AT G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;E.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> to the north of Paris, in the <i>zone
des arm&eacute;es</i>, there is a village, known to all
aviators in the French service as G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;E. It
is the village through which pilots who have
completed their training at the aviation schools
pass on their way to the front; and it is here
that I again take up this journal of aerial adventure.</p>

<p>We are in lodgings, Drew and I, at the H&ocirc;tel
de la Bonne Rencontre, which belies its name in
the most villainous fashion. An inn at Rochester
in the days of Henry the Fourth must
have been a fair match for it, and yet there is
something to commend it other than its convenience
to the flying field. Since the early
days of the Escadrille Lafayette, many Americans
have lodged here while awaiting their
orders for active service. As I write, J.&nbsp;B. is
asleep in a bed which has done service for a long
line of them. It is for this reason that he chose
it, in preference to one in a much better state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of repair which he might have had. And he
has made plans for its purchase after the war.
Madame Rodel is to keep careful record of all
its American occupants, just as she has done in
the past. She is pledged not to repair it beyond
the bare necessity which its uses as a bed may
require, an injunction which it was hardly
necessary to lay upon her, judging by the other
furniture in our apartment. Drew is not sentimental,
but he sometimes carries sentiment to
extremities which appear to me absurd.</p>

<p>When I attempt to define, even to myself,
the charm of our adventures thus far, I find it
impossible. How, then, make it real to others?
To tell of aerial adventure one needs a new language,
or, at least, a parcel of new adjectives,
sparkling with bright and vivid meaning, as
crisp and fresh as just-minted bank-notes.
They should have no taint of flatness or insipidity.
They should show not the faintest
trace of wear. With them, one might hope, now
and then, to startle the imagination, to set it
running in channels which are strange and delightful
to it. For there is something new under
the sun: aerial adventure; and the most lively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and unjaded fancy may, at first, need direction
toward the realization of this fact. Soon it will
have a literature of its own, of prose and poetry,
of fiction, biography, memoirs, of history
which will read like the romance it really is.
The essayists will turn to it with joy. And the
poets will discover new aspects of beauty
which have been hidden from them through
the ages; and as men's experience &#8220;in the wide
fields of air&#8221; increases, epic material which will
tax their most splendid powers.</p>

<p>This brings me sadly back to my own purpose,
which is, despite many wistful longings
of a more ambitious nature, to write a plain
tale of the adventures of two members&mdash;prospective
up to this point&mdash;of the Escadrille
Lafayette. To go back to some of those earlier
ones, when we were making our first cross-country
flights, I remember them now with a
delight which, at the time, was not unmixed
with other emotions. Indeed, an aviator, and
a fledgling aviator in particular, often runs the
whole gamut of human feeling during a single
flight. I did in the course of half an hour, reaching
the high C of acute panic as I came tumbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
out of the first cloud of my aerial experience.
Fortunately, in the air the sense of equilibrium
usually compels one to do the right
thing, and so, after some desperate handling of
my &#8220;broom-stick,&#8221; as the control is called which
governs ailerons and elevating planes, I soon
had the horizons nicely adjusted again. What
a relief it was! I shut down my motor and commenced
a more gradual descent, for I was lost,
of course, and it seemed wiser to land and make
inquiries than to go cruising over half of France
looking for one among hundreds of picturesque
old towns. There were at least a dozen within
view. Some of them were at least a three hours'
walk distant from each other. But in the air!
I was free to go whither I would, and swiftly.</p>

<p>After leisurely deliberation I selected one surrounded
by wide fields which appeared to be as
level as a floor. But as I descended the landscape
widened, billowing into hills and folding
into valleys. By sheer good luck, nothing more,
I made a landing without accident. My Caudron
barely missed colliding with a hedge of
fruit trees, rolled down a long incline, and
stopped not ten feet short of a small stream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The experience taught me the folly of choosing
landing-ground from high altitudes. I needn't
have landed, of course, but I was then so much
an amateur that the buffeting of cross-currents
of air near the ground awed me into it, come
what might. The village was out of sight over
the crest of the hill. However, thinking that
some one must have seen me, I decided to
await developments where I was.</p>

<p>Very soon I heard a shrill, jubilant shout.
A boy of eight or ten years was running along
the ridge as fast as he could go. Outlined
against the sky, he reminded me of silhouettes
I had seen in Paris shops, of children dancing,
the very embodiment of joy in movement. He
turned and waved to some one behind, whom
I could not see, then came on again, stopping
a short distance away, and looking at me with
an air of awe, which, having been a small boy
myself, I was able to understand and appreciate.
I said, &#8220;Bonjour, mon petit,&#8221; as cordially
as I could, but he just stood there and
gazed without saying a word. Then the others
began to appear: scores of children, and old
men as well, and women of all ages, some with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
babies in their arms, and young girls. The
whole village came, I am sure. I was mightily
impressed by the haleness of the old men and
women, which one rarely sees in America.
Some of them were evidently well over seventy,
and yet, with one or two exceptions, they had
sound limbs, clear eyes, and healthy complexions.
As for the young girls, many of them were
exceptionally pretty; and the children were
sturdy youngsters, not the wan, thin-legged
little creatures one sees in Paris. In fact, all of
these people appeared to belong to a different
race from that of the Parisians, to come from
finer, more vigorous stock.</p>

<p>They were very curious, but equally courteous,
and stood in a large circle around my machine,
waiting for me to make my wishes known.
For several minutes I pretended to be busy
attending to dials and valves inside the car.
While trying to screw my courage up to the
point of making a verbless explanation of my
difficulty, some one pushed through the crowd,
and to my great relief began speaking to me.
It was Monsieur the Mayor. As best I could,
I explained that I had lost my way and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
found it necessary to come down for the purpose
of making inquiries. I knew that it was
awful French, but hoped that it would be intelligible,
in part at least. However, the Mayor
understood not a word, and I knew by the
curious expression in his eyes that he must be
wondering from what weird province I hailed.
After a moment's thought he said, &#8220;Vous &ecirc;tes
Anglais, monsieur?&#8221; with a smile of very real
pleasure. I said, &#8220;Non, monsieur, Am&eacute;ricain.&#8221;</p>

<p>That magic word! What potency it has in
France, the more so at that time, perhaps, for
America had placed herself definitely upon the
side of the Allies only a short time before. I
enjoyed that moment. I might have had the
village for the asking. I willingly accepted the
r&ocirc;le of ambassador of the American people.
Had it not been for the language barrier, I
think I would have made a speech, for I felt
the generous spirit of Uncle Sam prompting
me to give those fathers and mothers, whose
husbands and sons were at the front, the
promise of our unqualified support. I wanted
to tell them that we were with them now, not
only in sympathy, but with all our resources<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in men and guns and ships and aircraft. I
wanted to convince them of our new understanding
of the significance of the war. Alas!
this was impossible. Instead I gave each one
of an army of small boys the privilege of sitting
in the pilot's seat, and showed them how to
manage the controls.</p>

<p>The astonishing thing to me was, that while
this village was not twenty kilometres off the
much-frequented air route between C&mdash;&mdash; and
R&mdash;&mdash;, mine was the first aeroplane which
most of them had seen. During long months
at various aviation schools pilots grow accustomed
to thinking that aircraft are as familiar
a sight to others as to them. But here was
a village, not far distant from several aviation
schools, where an aviator was looked upon
with wonder. To have an American aviator
drop down upon them was an event even in
the history of that ancient village. To have
been that aviator,&mdash;well, it was an unforgettable
experience, coming as it did so opportunely
with America's entry into the war. I
shall always have it in the background of memory,
and one day it will be among the pleasantest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of many pleasant tales which I shall
have in store for my grandchildren.</p>

<p>However, it is not their potentialities as
memories which endear these adventures now,
but rather it is because they are in such contrast
to any that we had known before. We
are always comparing this new life with the
old, so different in every respect as to seem a
separate existence, almost a previous incarnation.</p>

<p>Having been set right about my course, I
pushed my biplane to more level ground, with
the willing help of all the boys, started my
motor, and was away again. Their shrill cheers
reached me even above the roar of the motor.
As a lad in a small, Middle-Western town, I
have known the rapture of holding to a balloon
guy-rope at a county fair, until &#8220;the
world's most famous aeronaut&#8221; shouted, &#8220;Let
'er go, boys!&#8221; and swung off into space. I kept
his memory green until I had passed the first
age of hero worship. I know that every youngster
in a small village in central France will
so keep mine. Such fame is the only kind worth
having.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>A flight of fifteen minutes brought me within
sight of the large white circle which marks the
landing-field at R&mdash;&mdash;. J.&nbsp;B. had not yet arrived.
This was a great disappointment, for
we had planned a race home. I was anxious
about him, too, knowing that the godfather of
all adventurers can be very stern at times, particularly
with his aerial godchildren. I waited
for an hour and then decided to go on alone.
The weather having cleared, the opportunity
was too favorable to be lost. The cloud formations
were the most remarkable that I had
ever seen. I flew around and over and under
them, watching at close hand the play of light
and shade over their great, billowing folds.
Sometimes I skirted them so closely that the
current of air from my propeller raveled out
fragments of shining vapor, which streamed
into the clear spaces like wisps of filmy silk.
I knew that I ought to be savoring this experience,
but for some reason I couldn't. One
usually pays for a fine mood by a sudden and
unaccountable change of feeling which shades
off into a kind of dull, colorless depression.</p>

<p>I passed a twin-motor Caudron going in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
opposite direction. It was fantastically painted,
the wings a bright yellow and the circular
hoods, over the two motors, a fiery red. As it
approached, it looked like some prehistoric bird
with great ravenous eyes. The thing startled
me, not so much because of its weird appearance
as by the mere fact of its being there.
Strangely enough, for a moment it seemed
impossible that I should meet another <i>avion</i>.
Despite a long apprenticeship in aviation, in
these days when one's mind has only begun to
grasp the fact that the mastery of the air has
been accomplished, the sudden presentation of
a bit of evidence sometimes shocks it into a
moment of amazement bordering upon incredulity.</p>

<p>As I watched the big biplane pass, I was conscious
of a feeling of loneliness. I remembered
what J.&nbsp;B. had said that morning. There <i>was</i>
something unpleasant in the isolation; it made
us look longingly down to earth, wondering
whether we shall ever feel really at home in the
air. I, too, longed for the sound of human
voices, and all that I heard was the roar of the
motor and the swish of the wind through wires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and struts, sounds which have no human quality
in them, and are no more companionable
than the lapping of the waves to a man adrift
on a raft in mid-ocean. Underlying this feeling,
and no doubt in part responsible for it,
was the knowledge of the fallibility of that
seemingly perfect mechanism which rode so
steadily through the air; of the quick response
that ingenious arrangement of inanimate matter
would make to an eternal and inexorable
law if a few frail wires should part; of the
equally quick, but less phlegmatic response of
another fallible mechanism, capable of registering
horror, capable&mdash;it is said&mdash;of passing
its past life in review in the space of a few seconds,
and then&mdash;capable of becoming equally
inanimate matter.</p>

<p>Luckily nothing of this sort happened, and
the feeling of loneliness passed the moment I
came in sight of the long rows of barracks, the
hangars and machine shops of the aviation
school. My joy when I saw them can only be
appreciated in full by fellow aviators who remember
the end of their own first long flight.
I had been away for years. I would not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
been surprised to find great changes. If the
brevet monitor had come hobbling out to meet
me holding an ear trumpet in his withered
hand, the sight would have been quite in
keeping with my own sense of the lapse of
time. However, he approached with his ancient
springy, businesslike step, as I climbed
down from my machine. I swallowed to clear
the passage to my ears, and heard him say,
&#8220;Alors &ccedil;a va?&#8221; in a most disappointingly perfunctory
tone of voice.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where's your biograph?&#8221;</p>

<p>My biograph! It is the altitude-registering
instrument which also marks, on a cross-lined
chart, the time consumed on each lap of an
aerial voyage. My card should have shown
four neat outlines in ink, something like this&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/curve.jpg" width="500" height="97" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em;">one for each stage of my journey, including
the forced landing when I had lost my way.
But having started the mechanism going upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
leaving A&mdash;&mdash;, I had then forgotten all about it,
so that it had gone on running while my machine
was on the ground as well as during the
time it was in the air. The result was a sketch
of a magnificent mountain range which might
have been drawn by the futurist son, aged five,
of a futurist artist. Silently I handed over the
instrument. The monitor looked at it, and then
at me without comment. But there is an international
language of facial expression, and
his said, unmistakably, &#8220;You poor, simple
prune! You choice sample of mouldy American
cheese!&#8221;</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;B. didn't return until the following afternoon.
After leaving me over C&mdash;&mdash;, he had
blown out two spark-plugs. For a while he
limped along on six cylinders, and then landed
in a field three kilometres from the nearest
town. His French, which is worse, if that is
possible, than mine, aroused the suspicions of
a patriot farmer, who collared him as a possible
German spy. Under a bodyguard of two peasants,
armed with hoes, he was marched to a
neighboring ch&acirc;teau. And then, I should have
thought, he would have had another historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
illusion,&mdash;this time with a French Revolutionary
setting. He says not, however. All his
faculties were concentrated in enjoying this
unusual adventure; and he was wondering
what the outcome of it would be. At the ch&acirc;teau
he met a fine old gentleman who spoke
English with that nicety of utterance which
only a cultivated Frenchman can achieve. He
had no difficulty in clearing himself. Then he
had dinner in a hall hung with armor and hunting
trophies, was shown to a chamber half as
large as the lounge at the Harvard Club, and
slept in a bed which he got into by means of a
ladder of carved oak. This is a mere outline.
Out of regard for J.&nbsp;B.'s opinions about the
sanctities of his own personal adventures, I refrain
from giving further details.</p>

<p>These were the usual experiences which
every American pilot has had while on his
brevet flights. As I write I think of scores of
others, for they were of almost daily occurrence.</p>

<p>Jackson landed&mdash;unintentionally, of course&mdash;in
a town square and was banqueted by the
Mayor, although he had nearly run him down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a few hours earlier, and had ruined forever his
reputation as a man of dignified bearing. But
the Mayor was not alone in his forced display
of unseemly haste. Many other townspeople,
long past the nimbleness of youth, rushed for
shelter; and pride goeth before a collision with
a wayward aeroplane. Jackson said the sky
rained hats, market baskets, and wooden shoes
for five minutes after his Bl&eacute;riot had come to
rest on the steps of the <i>bureau de poste</i>. And no
one was hurt.</p>

<p>Murphy's defective motor provided him with
the names and addresses of every possible and
impossible <i>marraine</i> in the town of Y&mdash;&mdash;, near
which he was compelled to land. While waiting
for the arrival of his mechanician with a
new supply of spark-plugs, he left his monoplane
in a field close by. A path to the place
was worn by the feet of the young women of
the town, whose dearest wish appeared to be to
have an aviator as a <i>filleul</i>. They covered the
wings of his <i>avion</i> with messages in pencil. The
least pointed of these hints were, &#8220;&Eacute;crivez le
plus t&ocirc;t possible&#8221;; and, &#8220;Je voudrais bien un
filleul am&eacute;ricain, tr&egrave;s gentil, comme vous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Matthews' biplane crashed through the roof
of a camp bakery. If he had practiced this unusual
<i>atterrissage</i> a thousand times he could not
have done it so neatly as at the first attempt.
He followed the motor through to the kitchen
and finally hung suspended a few feet from the
ceiling. The army bread-bakers stared up at
him with faces as white as fear and flour could
make them. The commandant of the camp
rushed in. He asked, &#8220;What have you done
with the corpse?&#8221; The bread-bakers pointed to
Matthews, who apologized for his bad choice
of landing-ground. He was hardly scratched.</p>

<p>Mac lost his way in the clouds and landed
near a small village for gasoline and information.
The information he had easily, but gasoline
was scarce. After laborious search through
several neighboring villages he found a supply
and had it carried to the field where his machine
was waiting. Some farmer lads agreed
to hold on to the tail while Mac started the
engine. At the first roar of the rotary motor
they all let loose. The Bl&eacute;riot pushed Mac
contemptuously aside, lifted its tail and rushed
away. He followed it over a level tract of country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
miles in extent, and found it at last in a
ditch, nose down, tail in air, like a duck hunting
bugs in the mud. This story loses nine
tenths of its interest for want of Mac's pungent
method of telling it.</p>

<p>One of the <i>bona-fide</i> godchildren of Chance
was Millard. The circumstances leading to his
engagement in the French service as a member
of the Franco-American Corps proves this. Millard
was a real human being,&mdash;he had no grammar,
no polish, no razor, safety or otherwise,
but likewise no pretense, no &#8220;swank.&#8221; He was
<i>persona non grata</i> to a few, but the great
majority liked him very much, although they
wondered how in the name of all that is curious
he had ever decided to join the French air service.
Once he told us his history at great length.
He had been a scout in the Philippine service
of the American army. He had been a roustabout
on cattle boats. He had boiled his coffee
down by the stockyards in every sizable town
on every transcontinental railroad in America.
In the spring of 1916 he had employment with
a roofing company which had contracted for a
job in Richmond, Virginia, I think it was. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Richmond went &#8220;dry&#8221; in the State elections;
the roofing job fell through, owing, so Millard
insisted, to the natural and inevitable depression
which follows a dry election. Having lost
his prospective employment as a roofer, what
more natural than that he should turn to this
other high calling?</p>

<p>He was game. He tried hard and at last
reached his brevet tests. Three times he started
off on triangles. No one expected to see him
return, but he surprised them every time. He
could never find the towns where he was supposed
to land, so he would keep on going till
his gas gave out. Then his machine would
come down of itself, and Millard would crawl
out from under the wreckage and come back
by train.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; he would say doubtfully,
rubbing his eight-days' growth of beard; &#8220;I'm
seeing a lot of France, but this coming-down
business ain't what it's cracked up to be. I can
swing in on the rods of a box car with the train
going hell bent for election, but I guess I'm too
old to learn to fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The War Office came to this opinion after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Millard had smashed three machines in three
tries. Wherever he may be now, I am sure that
Chance is still ruling his destiny, and I hope,
with all my heart, benevolently.</p>

<p>Our final triangle was completed uneventfully.
J.&nbsp;B.'s motor behaved splendidly; I remembered
my biograph at every stage of the
journey, and we were at home again within
three hours. We did our altitude tests and were
then no longer <i>&eacute;l&egrave;ves-pilotes</i>, but <i>pilotes aviateurs</i>.
By reason of this distinction we passed
from the rank of soldier of the second class to
that of corporal. At the tailor's shop the wings
and star insignia were sewn upon our collars
and our corporal's stripes upon our sleeves. For
we were proud, as every aviator is proud, who
reaches the end of his apprenticeship and enters
into the dignity of a brevetted military
pilot.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Six months have passed since I made the last
entry in my journal. J.&nbsp;B. was asleep in his historic
bed, and I was sitting at a rickety table
writing by candle-light, stopping now and then
to listen to the mutter of guns on the Aisne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
front. It was only at night that we could hear
them, and then not often, the very ghost of
sound, as faint as the beating of the pulses in
one's ears. That was a May evening, and this,
one late in November. I arrived at the Gare du
Nord only a few hours ago. Never before have
I come to Paris with a finer sense of the joy
of living. I walked down the rue Lafayette,
through the rue de Provence, the rue du Havre,
to a little hotel in the vicinity of the Gare Saint-Lazare.
Under ordinary circumstances none of
these streets, nor the people in them, would
have appeared particularly interesting. But
on this occasion&mdash;it was the finest walk of my
life. I saw everything with the eyes of the <i>permissionnaire</i>,
and sniffed the odors of roasting
chestnuts, of restaurants, of shops, of people,
never so keenly aware of their numberless
variety.</p>

<p>After dinner I walked out on the boulevards
from the Madeleine to the Place de la R&eacute;publique,
through the maze of narrow streets to the
river, and over the Pont Neuf to Notre Dame.
I was surprised that the spell which Hugo gives
it should have lost none of its old potency for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
me after coming direct from the realities of
modern warfare. If he were writing this journal,
what a story it would be!</p>

<p>It will be necessary to pass rapidly over the
period between the day when we received our
<i>brevets militaires</i> and that upon which we
started for the front. The event which bulked
largest to us was, of course, the departure on
active service. Preceding it, and next in importance,
was the last phase of our training and
the culmination of it all, at the School of Acrobacy.
Preliminary to our work there, we had a
six weeks' course of instruction, first on the
twin-motor Caudron and then on various
types of the Nieuport biplane. We thought the
Caudron a magnificent machine. We liked the
steady throb of its powerful motors, the enormous
spread of its wings, the slow, ponderous
way it had of answering to the controls. It was
our business to take officer observers for long
trips about the country while they made photographs,
spotted dummy batteries, and perfected
themselves in the wireless code. At that
time the Caudron had almost passed its period
of usefulness at the front, and there was a prospect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of our being transferred to the yet larger
and more powerful Letord, a three-passenger
biplane carrying two machine gunners besides
the pilot, and from three to five machine guns.
This appealed to us mightily. J.&nbsp;B. was always
talking of the time when he would command
not only a machine, but also a &#8220;gang of men.&#8221;
However, being Americans, and recruited for
a particular combat corps which flies only single-seater
<i>avions de chasse</i>, we eventually followed
the usual course of training for such
pilots. We passed in turn to the Nieuport biplane,
which compares in speed and grace with
these larger craft as the flight of a swallow with
the movements of a great lazy buzzard. And
now the Nieuport has been surpassed, and almost
entirely supplanted, by the Spad of 140,
180, 200, and 230 horse-power, and we have
transferred our allegiance to each in turn, marveling
at the genius of the French in motor
and aircraft construction.</p>

<p>At last we were ready for acrobacy. I will
not give an account of the trials by means of
which one's ability as a combat pilot is most
severely tested. This belongs among the pages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of a textbook rather than in those of a journal
of this kind. But to us who were to undergo
the ordeal,&mdash;for it is an ordeal for the untried
pilot,&mdash;our typewritten notes on acrobacy
read like the pages of a fascinating romance.
A year or two ago these aerial maneuvers would
have been thought impossible. Now we were
all to do them as a matter of routine training.</p>

<p>The worst of it was, that our civilian pursuits
offered no criterion upon which to base
forecasts of our ability as acrobats. There was
J.&nbsp;B., for example. He knew a mixed metaphor
when he saw one, for he had had wide experience
with them as an English instructor at
a New England &#8220;prep&#8221; school. But he had
never done a barrel turn, or anything resembling
it. How was he to know what his reaction
would be to this bewildering maneuver, a series
of rapid, horizontal, corkscrew turns? And to
what use could I put my hazy knowledge of
Massachusetts statutes dealing with neglect
and non-support of family, in that exciting
moment when, for the first time, I should be
whirling earthward in a spinning nose-dive?
Accidents and fatalities were most frequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
at the school of acrobacy, for the reason that
one could not know, beforehand, whether he
would be able to keep his head, with the earth
gone mad, spinning like a top, standing on one
rim, turning upside down.</p>

<p>In the end we all mastered it after a fashion,
for the tests are by no means so difficult of accomplishment
as they appear to be. Up to this
time, November 28, 1917, there has been but
one American killed at it in French schools.
We were not all good acrobats. One must have
a knack for it which many of us will never be
able to acquire. The French have it in larger
proportion than do we Americans. I can think
of no sight more pleasing than that of a Spad
in the air, under the control of a skillful French
pilot. Swallows perch in envious silence on the
chimney pots, and the crows caw in sullen despair
from the hedgerows.</p>

<p>At G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;E., while awaiting our call to the
front, we perfected ourselves in these maneuvers,
and practiced them in combat and group
flying. There, the restraints of the schools were
removed, for we were supposed to be accomplished
pilots. We flew when and in what manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
we liked. Sometimes we went out in large
formations, for a long flight; sometimes, in
groups of two or three, we made sham attacks
on villages, or trains, or motor convoys on the
roads. It was forbidden to fly over Paris, and
for this reason we took all the more delight in
doing it. J.&nbsp;B. and I saw it in all its moods: in
the haze of early morning, at midday when the
air had been washed clean by spring rains, in
the soft light of afternoon,&mdash;domes, theaters,
temples, spires, streets, parks, the river, bridges,
all of it spread out in magnificent panorama.
We would circle over Montmartre, Neuilly, the
Bois, Saint-Cloud, the Latin Quarter, and then
full speed homeward, listening anxiously to the
sound of our motors until we spiraled safely
down over our aerodrome. Our monitor never
asked questions. He is one of many Frenchmen
whom we shall always remember with gratitude.</p>

<p>We learned the songs of all motors, the peculiarities
and uses of all types of French <i>avions</i>,
pushers and tractors, single motor and bimotor,
monoplace, biplace, and triplace, monoplane
and biplane. And we mingled with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
pilots of all these many kinds of aircraft. They
were arriving and departing by every train, for
G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;E. is the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t for old pilots from the
front, transferring from one branch of aviation
to another, as well as for new ones fresh
from the schools. In our talks with them, we
became convinced that the air service is forming
its traditions and developing a new type of
mind. It even has an odor, as peculiar to itself
as the smell of the sea to a ship. There are those
who say that it is only a compound of burnt
castor oil and gasoline. One might, with no
more truth, call the odor of a ship a mixture of
tar and stale cooking. But let it pass. It will
be all things to all men; I can sense it as I write,
for it gets into one's clothing, one's hair, one's
very blood.</p>

<p>We were as happy during those days at
G.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;E. as any one has the right to be. Our
whole duty was to fly, and never was the voice
of Duty heard more gladly. It was hard to keep
in mind the stern purpose behind this seeming
indulgence. At times I remembered Drew's
warning that we were military pilots and had no
right to forget the seriousness of the work before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
us. But he himself often forgot it for days together.
War on the earth may be reasonable
and natural, but in the air it seems the most
senseless folly. How is an airman, who has
just learned a new meaning for the joy of life,
to reconcile himself to the insane business of
killing a fellow aviator who may have just
learned it too? This was a question which we
sometimes put to ourselves in purely Arcadian
moments. We answered it, of course.</p>

<p>I was sitting at our two-legged table, writing
up my <i>carnet de vol</i>. Suzanne, the maid of all
work at the Bonne Rencontre, was sweeping a
passageway along the center of the room, telling
me, as she worked, about her family. She was
ticking off the names of her brothers and sisters,
when Drew put his head through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Il y a Pierre,&#8221; said Suzanne.</p>

<p>&#8220;We're posted,&#8221; said J.&nbsp;B.</p>

<p>&#8220;Et H&eacute;l&egrave;ne,&#8221; she continued.</p>

<p>I shall never know the names of the others.</p>



<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></h2>

<h3><a name="OUR_FIRST_PATROL" id="OUR_FIRST_PATROL"></a>OUR FIRST PATROL</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> got down from the train late in the afternoon
at a village which reminded us, at first
glance, of a boom town in the Far West. Crude
shelters of corrugated iron and rough pine
boards faced each other down the length of one
long street. They looked sadly out of place in
that landscape. They did not have the cheery,
buoyant ugliness of pioneer homes in an unsettled
country, for behind them were the ruins
of the old village, fragments of blackened wall,
stone chimneys filled with accumulations of
rubbish, garden-plots choked with weeds, reminding
us that here was no outpost of a new
civilization, but the desolation of an old one,
fallen upon evil days.</p>

<p>A large crowd of <i>permissionnaires</i> had left
the train with us. We were not at ease among
these men, many of them well along in middle
life, bent and streaming with perspiration under
their heavy packs. We were much better able
than most of them to carry our belongings, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
endure the fatigue of a long night march to billets
or trenches; and we were waiting for the
motor in which we should ride comfortably to
our aerodrome. There we should sleep in beds,
well housed from the weather, and far out of
the range of shell fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn't fair,&#8221; said J.&nbsp;B. &#8220;It is going to war
<i>de luxe</i>. These old poilus ought to be the aviators.
But, hang it all! Of course, they couldn't
be. Aviation is a young man's business. It has
to be that way. And you can't have aerodromes
along the front-line trenches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it did seem very unfair, and
we were uncomfortable among all those infantrymen.
The feeling increased when attention
was called to our branch of the service by the
distant booming of anti-aircraft guns. There
were shouts in the street, &#8220;A Boche!&#8221; We hurried
to the door of the caf&eacute; where we had been
hiding. Officers were ordering the crowds off
the street. &#8220;Hurry along there! Under cover!
Oh, I know that you're brave enough, mon
enfant. It isn't that. He's not to see all these
soldiers here. That's the reason. Allez! Vite!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soldiers were going into dugouts and cellars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
among the ruined houses. Some of them, seeing
us at the door of the caf&eacute;, made pointed remarks
as they passed, grumbling loudly at the
laxity of the air service.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's up there you ought to be, mon vieux,
not here,&#8221; one of them said, pointing to the
white <i>&eacute;clatements</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that?&#8221; said another. &#8220;He's a
Boche, not French, I can tell you that. Where
are your comrades?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was much good-natured chaffing as
well, but through it all I could detect a note of
resentment. I sympathized with their point of
view then as I do now, although I know that
there is no ground for the complaint of laxity.
Here is a German over French territory. Where
are the French aviators? Soldiers forget that
aerial frontiers must be guarded in two dimensions,
and that it is always possible for an
airman to penetrate far into enemy country.
They do not see their own pilots on their long
raids into German territory. Furthermore,
while the outward journey is often accomplished
easily enough, the return home is a different
matter. Telephones are busy from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
moment the lines are crossed, and a hostile
patrol, to say nothing of a lone <i>avion</i>, will be
fortunate if it returns safely.</p>

<p>But infantrymen are to be forgiven readily
for their outbursts against the aviation service.
They have far more than their share of danger
and death while in the trenches. To have their
brief periods of rest behind the lines broken into
by enemy aircraft&mdash;who would blame them
for complaining? And they are often generous
enough with their praise.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was no bombing. The
German remained at a great height and quickly
turned northward again.</p>

<p>Dunham and Miller came to meet us. We
had all four been in the schools together, they
preceding us on active service only a couple of
months. Seeing them after this lapse of time, I
was conscious of a change. They were keen
about life at the front, but they talked of their
experiences in a way which gave one a feeling
of tension, a tautness of muscles, a kind of ache
in the throat. It set me to thinking of a conversation
I had had with an old French pilot,
several months before. It came apropos of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
nothing. Perhaps he thought that I was sizing
him up, wondering how he could be content
with an instructor's job while the war is in progress.
He said: &#8220;I've had five hundred hours
over the lines. You don't know what that
means, not yet. I'm no good any more. It's
strain. Let me give you some advice. Save
your nervous energy. You will need all you
have and more. Above everything else, don't
think at the front. The best pilot is the best
machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dunham was talking about patrols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two a day of two hours each. Occasionally
you will have six hours' flying, but almost never
more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about voluntary patrols?&#8221; Drew
asked. &#8220;I don't suppose there is any objection,
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miller pounded Dunham on the back, singing,
&#8220;<i>Hi-doo-dedoo-dum-di</i>. What did I tell
you! Do I win?&#8221; Then he explained. &#8220;We
asked the same question when we came out,
and every other new pilot before us. This voluntary
patrol business is a kind of standing
joke. You think, now, that four hours a day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
over the lines is a light programme. For the
first month or so you will go out on your own
between times. After that, no. Of course,
when they call for a voluntary patrol for some
necessary piece of work, you will volunteer out
of a sense of duty. As I say, you may do as
much flying as you like. But wait. After a
month, or we'll give you six weeks, that will be
no more than you have to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were not at all convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do with the rest of your
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep,&#8221; said Dunham. &#8220;Read a good deal.
Play some poker or bridge. Walk. But sleep is
the chief amusement. Eight hours used to be
enough for me. Now I can do with ten or
twelve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew said: &#8220;That's all rot. You fellows are
having it too soft. They ought to put you on
the school r&eacute;gime again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let 'em talk, Dunham. They know. J.&nbsp;B.
says it's laziness. Let it go at that. Well,
take it from me, it's contagious. You'll soon
be victims.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dropped out of the conversation in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
look around me. Drew did all of the questioning,
and thanks to his interest, I got many hints
about our work which came back opportunely,
afterward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think down to the gunners. That will help
a lot. It's a game after that: your skill against
theirs. I couldn't do it at first, and shell fire
seemed absolutely damnable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you want to remember that a chasse
machine is almost never brought down by
anti-aircraft fire. You are too fast for them.
You can fool 'em in a thousand ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been flying for two weeks before I
saw a Boche. They are not scarce on this sector,
don't worry. I simply couldn't see them.
The others would have scraps. I spent most of
my time trying to keep track of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my tip, J.&nbsp;B., don't be too anxious to
mix it with the first German you see, because
very likely he will be a Frenchman, and if he
isn't, if he is a good Hun pilot, you'll simply
be meat for him&mdash;at first, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that all the Boche aviators on
this front have had several months' experience
in Russia or the Balkans. They train them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
there before they send them to the Western
Front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your best chance of being brought down
will come in the first two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's comforting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sans blague. Honestly, you'll be almost
helpless. You don't see anything, and
you don't know what it is that you do see.
Here's an example. On one of my first sorties I
happened to look over my shoulder and I saw
five or six Germans in the most beautiful alignment.
And they were all slanting up to dive on
me. I was scared out of my life: went down full
motor, then cut and fell into a vrille. Came out
of that and had another look. There they were
in the same position, only farther away. I
didn't tumble even then, except farther down.
Next time I looked, the five Boches, or six,
whichever it was, had all been raveled out by
the wind. &Eacute;clats d'obus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have heard about Franklin's
Boche. He got it during his first combat. He
didn't know that there was a German in the
sky, until he saw the tracer bullets. Then the
machine passed him about thirty metres away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
And he kept going down: may have had motor
trouble. Franklin said that he had never had
such a shock in his life. He dived after him,
spraying all space with his Vickers, and he got
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That all depends on the man. In chasse,
unless you are sent out on a definite mission,
protecting photographic machines or avions de
bombardement, you are absolutely on your
own. Your job is to patrol the lines. If a man
is built that way, he can loaf on the job. He
need never have a fight. At two hundred kilometres
an hour, it won't take him very long to
get out of danger. He stays out his two hours
and comes in with some framed-up tale to account
for his disappearance: 'Got lost. Went
off by himself into Germany. Had motor
trouble; gun jammed, and went back to arm it.'
He may even spray a few bullets toward Germany
and call it a combat. Oh, he can find
plenty of excuses, and he can get away with
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's spreading it, Dunham. What about
Huston? is he getting away with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don't let's get personal. Very likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Huston can't help it. Anyway, it is a matter of
temperament mostly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Temperament, hell! There's Van, for example.
I happen to know that he has to take
himself by his bootlaces every time he crosses
into Germany. But he sticks it. He has never
played a yellow trick. I hand it to him for
pluck above every other man in the squadron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Talbott and Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord! They haven't any nerves. It's no
job for them to do their work well.&#8221;</p>

<p>This conversation continued during the rest
of the journey. The life of a military pilot offers
exceptional opportunities for research in the
matter of personal bravery. Dunham and Miller
agreed that it is a varying quality. Sometimes
one is really without fear; at others only
a sense of shame prevents one from making a
very sad display.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huston is no worse than some of the rest of
us, only he hasn't a sense of shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he has the courage to be a coward,
and that is more than you have, son, or I either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our fellow pilots of the Lafayette Corps were
lounging outside the barracks on our arrival.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
They gave us a welcome which did much to remove
our feelings of strangeness; but we knew
that they were only mildly interested in the
news from the schools and were glad when they
let us drop into the background of conversation.
By a happy chance mention was made of
a recent newspaper article of some of the exploits
of the <i>Escadrille</i>, written evidently by a
very imaginative journalist; and from this the
talk passed to the reputation of the Squadron in
America, and the almost fabulous deeds credited
to it by some newspaper correspondents.
One pilot said that he had kept record of the
number of German machines actually reported
as having been brought down by members of
the Corps. I don't remember the number he
gave, but it was an astonishing total. The daily
average was so high, that, granting it to be correct,
America might safely have abandoned her
far-reaching aerial programme. Long before
her first pursuit squadron could be ready for
service, the last of the imperial German air-fleet
would, to quote from the article, have
&#8220;crashed in smouldering ruin on the war-devastated
plains of northern France.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>In this connection I can't forbear quoting
from another, one of the brightest pages in the
journalistic history of the legendary Escadrille
Lafayette. It is an account of a sortie said to
have taken place on the receipt of news of
America's declaration of war.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Uncle Sam is with us, boys! Come on! Let's
get those fellows!&#8221; These were the stirring words
of Captain Georges Th&eacute;nault, the valiant leader
of the Escadrille Lafayette, upon the morning
when news was received that the United States
of America had declared war upon the rulers of
Potsdam. For the first time in history, the Stars
and Stripes of Old Glory were flung to the breeze
over the camp, in France, of American fighting
men. Inspired by the sight, and spurred to instant
action by the ringing call of their French
captain, this band of aviators from the U.S.A.
sprang into their trim little biplanes. There was
a deafening roar of motors, and soon the last airman
had disappeared in the smoky haze which
hung over the distant battle-lines.</p>

<p>We cannot follow them on that journey. We
cannot see them as they mount higher and higher
into the morning sky, on their way to meet their
prey. But we may await their return. We may
watch them as they descend to their flying-field,
dropping down to earth, one by one. We may
learn, then, of their adventures on that flight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
death: how, far back of the German lines, they
encountered a formidable battle-squadron of the
enemy, vastly superior to their own in numbers.
Heedless of the risk they swooped down upon
their foe. Lieutenant A&mdash;&mdash; was attacked by
four enemy planes at the same time. One he sent
hurtling to the ground fifteen thousand feet below.
He caused a second to retire disabled.
Sergeant B&mdash;&mdash; accounted for another in a running
fight which lasted for more than a quarter of an
hour. Adjutant C&mdash;&mdash;, although his biplane was
riddled with bullets, succeeded, by a clever ruse,
in decoying two pursuers, bent on his destruction,
to the vicinity of a cloud where several of
his comrades were lying in wait for further victims.
A moment later both Germans were seen
to fall earthward, spinning like leaves in that last
terrible dive of death. &#8220;These boys are Yankee
aviators. They form the vanguard of America's
aerial forces. We need thousands of others just
like them,&#8221; etc.</p></div>

<p>Stories of this kind have, without doubt, a
certain imaginative appeal. J.&nbsp;B. and I had
often read them, never wholly credulous, of
course, but with feelings of uneasiness. Discounting
them by more than half, we still had
serious doubts of our ability to measure up to
the standard set by our fellow Americans who
had preceded us on active service. We were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
part reassured during our first afternoon at the
front. If these men were the demons on wings
of the newspapers, they took great pains to give
us a different impression.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Many of the questions which had long been
accumulating in our minds got themselves answered
during the next few days, while we were
waiting for machines. We knew, in a general
way, what the nature of our work would be.
We knew that the Escadrille Lafayette was one
of four pursuit squadrons occupying hangars on
the same field, and that, together, these formed
what is called a <i>groupe de combat</i>, with a definite
sector of front to cover. We had been told that
combat pilots are &#8220;the police of the air,&#8221; whose
duty it is to patrol the lines, harass the enemy,
attacking whenever possible, thus giving protection
to their own <i>corps-d'arm&eacute;e</i> aircraft&mdash;which
are only incidentally fighting machines&mdash;in
their work of reconnaissance, photography,
artillery direction, and the like. But we
did not know how this general theory of combat
is given practical application. When I
think of the depths of our ignorance, to be filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
in, day by day, with a little additional experience;
of our self-confidence, despite warnings;
of our willingness to leave so much for our
&#8220;godfather&#8221; Chance to decide, it is with feelings
nearly akin to awe. We awaited our first
patrol almost ready to believe that it would be
our first victorious combat. We had no realization
of the conditions under which aerial
battles are fought. Given good-will, average
ability, and the opportunity, we believed that
the results must be decisive, one way or the
other.</p>

<p>Much of our enforced leisure was spent at the
bureau of the group, where the pilots gathered
after each sortie to make out their reports.
There we heard accounts of exciting combats,
of victories and narrow escapes, which sounded
like impossible fictions. A few of them may
have been, but not many. They were told simply,
briefly, as a part of the day's work, by men
who no longer thought of their adventures as
being either very remarkable or very interesting.
What, I thought, will seem interesting or
remarkable to them after the war, after such a
life as this? Once an American gave me a hint:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
&#8220;I'm going to apply for a job as attendant in a
natural-history museum.&#8221;</p>

<p>Only a few minutes before, these men had
been taking part in aerial battles, attacking infantry
in trenches, or enemy transport on roads
fifteen or twenty kilometres away. And while
they were talking of these things the drone of
motors overhead announced the departure of
other patrols to battle-lines which were only
five minutes distant by the route of the air.
For when weather permitted there was an interlapping
series of patrols flying over the sector
from daylight till dark. The number of these,
and the number of <i>avions</i> in each patrol, varied
as circumstances demanded.</p>

<p>On one wall of the bureau hung a large-scale
map of the sector, which we examined square
by square with that delight which only the
study of maps can give. Trench-systems, both
French and German, were outlined upon it in
minute detail. It contained other features of a
very interesting nature. On another wall there
was a yet larger map, made of aeroplane photographs
taken at a uniform altitude and so
pieced together that the whole was a complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
picture of our sector of front. We spent hours
over this one. Every trench, every shell hole,
every splintered tree or fragment of farmhouse
wall stood out clearly. We could identify
machine-gun posts and battery positions. We
could see at a glance the result of months of
fighting; how terribly men had suffered under
a rain of high explosives at this point, how
lightly they had escaped at another; and so we
could follow, with a certain degree of accuracy,
what must have been the infantry actions at
various parts of the line.</p>

<p>The history of these trench campaigns will
have a forbidding interest to the student of the
future; for, as he reads of the battles on the
Aisne, the Somme, of Verdun and Flanders, he
will have spread out before him photographs of
the battlefields themselves, just as they were at
different phases of the struggle. With a series
of these pictorial records, men will be able to
find the trenches from which their fathers or
grandfathers scrambled with their regiments to
the attack, the wire entanglements which held
up the advance at one point, the shell holes
where they lay under machine-gun fire. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
often they will see the men themselves as they
advanced through the barrage fire, the sun
glinting on their helmets. It will be a fascinating
study, in a ghastly way; and while such
records exist, the outward meanings, at least,
of modern warfare will not be forgotten.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Tiffin, the messroom steward, was standing
by my cot with a lighted candle in his hand.
The furrows in his kindly old face were outlined
in shadow. His bald head gleamed like
the bottom of a yellow bowl. He said, &#8220;Beau
temps, monsieur,&#8221; put the candle on my table,
and went out, closing the door softly. I looked
at the window square, which was covered with
oiled cloth for want of glass. It was a black
patch showing not a glimmer of light.</p>

<p>The other pilots were gathering in the messroom,
where a fire was going. Some one started
the phonograph. Fritz Kreisler was playing the
&#8220;Chansons sans Paroles.&#8221; This was followed by
a song, &#8220;Oh, movin' man, don't take ma baby
grand.&#8221; It was a strange combination, and to
hear them, at that hour of the morning, before
going out for a first sortie over the lines, gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
me a &#8220;mixed-up&#8221; feeling, which it was impossible
to analyze.</p>

<p>Two patrols were to leave the field at the
same time, one to cover the sector at an altitude
of from two thousand to three thousand metres,
the other, thirty-five hundred to five thousand
metres. J.&nbsp;B. and I were on high patrol. Owing
to our inexperience, it was to be a purely defensive
one between our observation balloons and
the lines. We had still many questions to ask,
but having been so persistently inquisitive for
three days running, we thought it best to wait
for Talbott, who was leading our patrol, to volunteer
his instructions.</p>

<p>He went to the door to look at the weather.
There were clouds at about three thousand metres,
but the stars were shining through gaps in
them. On the horizon, in the direction of the
lines, there was a broad belt of blue sky. The
wind was blowing into Germany. He came
back yawning. &#8220;We'll go up&mdash;ho, hum!&#8221;&mdash;tremendous
yawn&mdash;&#8220;through a hole before we
reach the river. It's going to be clear presently,
so the higher we go the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others yawned sympathetically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I don't feel very pugnastic this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's a crime to send men out at this time of
day&mdash;night, rather.&#8221;</p>

<p>More yawns of assent, of protest. J.&nbsp;B. and I
were the only ones fully awake. We had finished
our chocolate and were watching the
clock uneasily, afraid that we should be late
getting started. Ten minutes before patrol
time we went out to the field. The canvas
hangars billowed and flapped, and the wooden
supports creaked with the quiet sound made
by ships at sea. And there was almost the peace
of the sea there, intensified, if anything, by the
distant rumble of heavy cannonading.</p>

<p>Our Spad biplanes were drawn up in two long
rows, outside the hangars. They were in exact
alignment, wing to wing. Some of them were
clean and new, others discolored with smoke
and oil; among these latter were the ones which
J.&nbsp;B. and I were to fly. Being new pilots we
were given used machines to begin with, and
ours had already seen much service. <i>Fuselage</i>
and wings had many patches over the scars of
old battles, but new motors had been installed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the bodies overhauled, and they were ready for
further adventures.</p>

<p>It mattered little to us that they were old.
They were to carry us out to our first air battles;
they were the first <i>avions</i> which we could
call our own, and we loved them in an almost
personal way. Each machine had an Indian
head, the symbol of the Lafayette Corps,
painted on the sides of the <i>fuselage</i>. In addition,
it bore the personal mark of its pilot,&mdash;a triangle,
a diamond, a straight band, or an initial,&mdash;painted
large so that it could be easily seen and
recognized in the air.</p>

<p>The mechanicians were getting the motors
<i>en route</i>, arming the machine guns, and giving
a final polish to the glass of the wind-shields.
In a moment every machine was turning over
<i>ralenti</i>, with the purring sound of powerful engines
which gives a voice to one's feeling of excitement
just before patrol time. There was
no more yawning, no languid movement.</p>

<p>Rodman was buttoning himself into a combination
suit which appeared to add another
six inches to his six feet two. Barry, who was
leading the low patrol, wore a woolen helmet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which left only his eyes uncovered. I had not
before noticed how they blazed and snapped.
All his energy seemed to be concentrated in
them. Porter wore a leather face-mask, with
a lozenge-shaped breathing-hole, and slanted
openings covered with yellow glass for eyes.
He was the most fiendish-looking demon of
them all. I was glad to turn from him to the
Duke, who wore a <i>passe-montagne</i> of white silk
which fitted him like a bonnet. As he sat in his
machine, adjusting his goggles, he might have
passed for a dear old lady preparing to read a
chapter from the Book of Daniel. The fur of
Dunham's helmet had frayed out, so that it
fitted around the sides of his face and under the
chin like a beard, the kind worn by old-fashioned
sailors.</p>

<p>The strain of waiting patiently for the start
was trying. The sudden transformation of a
group of typical-looking Americans into monsters
and devotional old ladies gave a moment
of diversion which helped to relieve it.</p>

<p>I heard Talbott shouting his parting instructions
and remembered that I did not know the
rendezvous. I was already strapped in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
machine and was about to loosen the fastenings,
when he came over and climbed on the step of
the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rendezvous two thousand over field!&#8221; he
yelled.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know me&mdash;Big T&mdash;wings&mdash;fuselage. I'll&mdash;turning
right. You and others left. When&mdash;see
me start&mdash;lines, fall in behind&mdash;left.
Remember stick close&mdash;patrol. If&mdash;get lost,
better&mdash;home. Compass southwest. Look carefully&mdash;landmarks
going out. Got&mdash;straight?&#8221;</p>

<p>I nodded again to show that I understood.
Machines of both patrols were rolling across
the field, a mechanician running along beside
each one. I joined the long line, and taxied
over to the starting-point, where the captain
was superintending the send-off, and turned
into the wind in my turn. As though conscious
of his critical eye, my old veteran Spad lifted
its tail and gathered flying speed with all the
vigor of its youth, and we were soon high above
the hangars, climbing to the rendezvous.</p>

<p>When we had all assembled, Talbott headed
northeast, the rest of us falling into our places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
behind him. Then I found that, despite the
new motor, my machine was not a rapid climber.
Talbott noticed this and kept me well in
the group, he and the others losing height in
<i>renversements</i> and <i>retournements</i>, diving under
me and climbing up again. It was fascinating
to watch them doing stunts, to observe the
constant changing of positions. Sometimes we
seemed, all of us, to be hanging motionless,
then rising and falling like small boats riding a
heavy swell. Another glance would show one of
them suspended bottom up, falling sidewise,
tipped vertically on a wing, standing on its tail,
as though being blown about by the wind, out
of all control. It is only in the air, when moving
with them, that one can really appreciate the
variety and grace of movement of a flock of
high-powered <i>avions de chasse</i>.</p>

<p>I was close to Talbott as we reached the cloud-bank.
I saw him in dim silhouette as the mist,
sunlight-filtered, closed around us. Emerging
into the clear, fine air above it, we might have
been looking at early morning from the casement</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">&#8220;opening on the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perilous seas, in fa&euml;ry lands forlorn.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The sun was just rising, and the floor of cloud
glowed with delicate shades of rose and amethyst
and gold. I saw the others rising through
it at widely scattered points. It was a glorious
sight.</p>

<p>Then, forming up and turning northward
again, just as we passed over the receding edge
of the cloud-bank, I saw the lines. It was still
dusk on the ground and my first view was that
of thousands of winking lights, the flashes of
guns and of bursting shells. At that time the
Germans were making trials of the French
positions along the Chemin des Dames, and
the artillery fire was unusually heavy.</p>

<p>The lights soon faded and the long, winding
battle-front emerged from the shadow, a broad
strip of desert land through a fair, green country.
We turned westward along the sector,
several kilometres within the French lines, for
J.&nbsp;B. and I were to have a general view of it all
before we crossed to the other side. The fort of
Malmaison was a minute square, not as large
as a postage-stamp. With thumb and forefinger
I could have spanned the distance between Soissons
and Laon. Clouds of smoke were rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from Allemant to Craonne, and these were constantly
added to by infinitesimal puffs in black
and white. I knew that shells of enormous calibre
were wrecking trenches, blasting out huge
craters; and yet not a sound, not the faintest
reverberation of a gun. Here was a sight almost
to make one laugh at man's idea of the importance
of his pygmy wars.</p>

<p>But the Olympian mood is a fleeting one. I
think of Paradis rising on one elbow out of the
slime where he and his comrades were lying,
waving his hand toward the wide, unspeakable
landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we, we chaps? And what's all
this here? Nothing at all. All we can see is only
a speck. When one speaks of the whole war,
it's as if you said nothing at all&mdash;the words
are strangled. We're here, and we look at it like
blind men.&#8221;</p>

<p>To look down from a height of more than
two miles, on an endless panorama of suffering
and horror, is to have the sense of one's littleness
even more painfully quickened. The best
that the airman can do is to repeat, &#8220;We're
here, and we look at it like blind men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>We passed on to the point where the line
bends northward, then turned back. I tried to
concentrate my attention on the work of identifying
landmarks. It was useless. One might
as well attempt to study Latin grammar at his
first visit to the Grand Ca&ntilde;on. My thoughts
went wool-gathering. Looking up suddenly, I
found that I was alone.</p>

<p>To the new pilot the sudden appearance or
disappearance of other <i>avions</i> is a weird thing.
He turns his head for a moment. When he
looks again, his patrol has vanished. Combats
are matters of a few seconds' duration, rarely
of more than two or three minutes. The opportunity
for attack comes almost with the swiftness
of thought and has passed as quickly.
Looking behind me, I was in time to see one
machine tip and dive. Then it, too, vanished
as though it had melted into the air. Shutting
my motor, I started down, swiftly, I thought;
but I had not yet learned to fall vertically, and
the others&mdash;I can say almost with truth&mdash;were
miles below me. I passed long streamers
of white smoke, crossing and recrossing in the
air. I knew the meaning of these, machine-gun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tracer bullets. The delicately penciled lines had
not yet frayed out in the wind. I went on down
in a steep spiral, guiding myself by them, and
seeing nothing. At the point where they ended,
I redressed and put on my motor. My altimeter
registered two thousand metres. By a curious
chance, while searching the empty sky, I
saw a live shell passing through the air. It was
just at the second when it reached the top of
its trajectory and started to fall. &#8220;Lord!&#8221; I
thought, &#8220;I have seen a shell, and yet I can't
find my patrol!&#8221;</p>

<p>While coming down I had given no attention
to my direction. I had lost twenty-five hundred
metres in height. The trenches were now
plainly visible, and the brown strip of sterile
country where they lay was vastly broader.
Several times I felt the concussion of shell explosions,
my machine being lifted and then
dropped gently with an uneasy motion. Constantly
searching the air, I gave no thought to
my position with reference to the lines, nor to
the possibility of anti-aircraft fire. Talbott had
said: &#8220;Never fly in a straight line for more
than fifteen seconds. Keep changing your direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
constantly, but be careful not to fly in a
regularly irregular fashion. The German gunners
may let you alone at first, hoping that you
will become careless, or they may be plotting
out your style of flight. Then they make their
calculations and they let you have it. If you
have been careless, they'll put 'em so close,
there'll be no question about the kind of a
scare you will have.&#8221;</p>

<p>There wasn't in my case. I was looking for
my patrol to the exclusion of thought of anything
else. The first shell burst so close that
I lost control of my machine for a moment.
Three others followed, two in front, and one
behind, which I believed had wrecked my tail.
They burst with a terrific rending sound in
clouds of coal-black smoke. A few days before
I had been watching without emotion the
bombardment of a German plane. I had seen
it twisting and turning through the <i>&eacute;clatements</i>,
and had heard the shells popping faintly,
with a sound like the bursting of seed-pods in
the sun.</p>

<p>My feeling was not that of fear, exactly. It
was more like despair. Every airman must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
have known it at one time or another, a sudden
overwhelming realization of the pitilessness of
the forces which men let loose in war. In that
moment one doesn't remember that men have
loosed them. He is alone, and he sees the face
of an utterly evil thing. Miller's advice was,
&#8220;Think down to the gunners&#8221;; but this is impossible
at first. Once a French captain told
me that he talked to the shells. &#8220;I say, 'Bonjour,
mon vieux! Tiens! Comment &ccedil;a va, toi!
Ah, non! je suis press&eacute;!' or something like that.
It amuses one.&#8221;</p>

<p>This need of some means of humanizing shell
fire is common. Aviators know little of modern
warfare as it touches the infantryman; but in
one respect, at least, they are less fortunate.
They miss the human companionship which
helps a little to mask its ugliness.</p>

<p>However, it is seldom that one is quite alone,
without the sight of friendly planes near at
hand, and there is a language of signs which,
in a way, fills this need. One may &#8220;waggle his
flippers,&#8221; or &#8220;flap his wings,&#8221; to use the common
expressions, and thus communicate with
his comrades. Unfortunately for my ease of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
mind, there were no comrades present with
whom I could have conversed in this way.
Miller was within five hundred metres and saw
me all the time, although I didn't know this
until later.</p>

<p>Talbott's instructions were, &#8220;If you get lost,
go home&#8221;&mdash;somewhat ambiguous. I knew
that my course to the aerodrome was southwest.
At any rate, by flying in that direction I
was certain to land in France. But with German
gunners so keen on the baptism-of-fire
business, I had been turning in every direction,
and the floating disk of my compass was revolving
first to the right, then to the left. In
order to let it settle, I should have to fly straight
for some fixed point for at least half a minute.
Under the circumstances I was not willing to do
this. A compass which would point north immediately
and always would be a heaven-sent
blessing to the inexperienced pilot during his
first few weeks at the front. Mine was saying
North&mdash;northwest&mdash;west&mdash;southwest&mdash;south&mdash;southeast&mdash;east&mdash;and
after a moment
of hesitation reading off the points in the
reverse order. The wind was blowing into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Germany, and unconsciously, in trying to find
a way out of the <i>&eacute;clatements</i>, I was getting farther
and farther away from home and coming
within range of additional batteries of hostile
anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<p>I might have landed at Karlsruhe or Cologne,
had it not been for Miller. My love for concentric
circles of red, white, and blue dates
from the moment when I saw the French
<i>cocarde</i> on his Spad.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I had been a Hun!&#8221; he said, when we
landed at the aerodrome. &#8220;Oh, man! you were
fruit salad! Fruit salad, I tell you! I could have
speared you with my eyes shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>I resented the implication of defenselessness.
I said that I was keeping my eyes open, and if
he had been a Hun, the fruit salad might not
have been so palatable as it looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me this: Did you see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought for a moment, and then said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you passed over my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And twenty seconds before that you would
have been a sieve, if either of us had been a
Boche.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I yielded the point to save further argument.</p>

<p>He had come swooping down fairly suddenly.
When I saw him making his way so saucily
among the <i>&eacute;clatements</i> I felt my confidence returning
in increasing waves. I began to use
my head, and found that it was possible to
make the German gunners guess badly. There
was no menace in the sound of shells barking
at a distance, and we were soon clear of all of
them.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;B. took me aside the moment I landed.
He had one of his fur boots in his hand and
was wearing the other. He had also lighted the
cork end of his cigarette. To one acquainted
with his magisterial orderliness of mind and
habit, these signs were eloquent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, keep this quiet!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don't
want the others to know it, but I've just had
the adventure of my life. I attacked a German.
Great Scott! what an opportunity! and
I bungled it through being too eager!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just after the others dove. You remember&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him, briefly, of my experience, adding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
&#8220;And I didn't know there was a German in
sight until I saw the smoke of the tracer
bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither did I, only I didn't see even the
smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>This cheered me immensely. &#8220;What! you
didn't&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I saw nothing but sky where the others
had disappeared. I was looking for them when
I saw the German. He was about four hundred
metres below me. He couldn't have seen me,
I think, because he kept straight on. I dove,
but didn't open fire until I could have a nearer
view of his black crosses. I wanted to be sure.
I had no idea that I was going so much faster.
The first thing I knew I was right on him. Had
to pull back on my stick to keep from crashing
into him. Up I went and fell into a nose-dive.
When I came out of it there was no sign of the
German, and I hadn't fired a shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you come home alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I had the luck to meet the others just
afterward. Now, not a word of this to any
one!&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no need for secrecy. The near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
combat had been seen by both Talbott and
Porter. At luncheon we both came in for our
share of ragging.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have seen them following us
down!&#8221; said Porter; &#8220;like two old rheumatics
going into the subway. We saw them both
when we were taking height again. The scrap
was all over hours before, and they were still a
thousand metres away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to dive vertically. Needn't
worry about your old 'bus. She'll stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the Lord has certainly protected the
innocent to-day!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of them was wandering off into Germany.
Bill had to waggle Miller to page him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there was Drew, going down on that
biplane we were chasing. I've been trying to
think of one wrong thing he might have done
which he didn't do. First he dove with the sun
in his face, when he might have had it at his
back. Then he came all the way in full view,
instead of getting under his tail. Good thing
the mitrailleur was firing at us. After that,
when he had the chance of a lifetime, he fell
into a vrille and scared the life out of the rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of us. I thought the gunner had turned on
him. And while we were following him down
to see where he was going to splash, the Boche
got away.&#8221;</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">All this happened months ago, but every
trifling incident connected with our first patrol
is still fresh in mind. And twenty years from
now, if I chance to hear the &#8220;Chansons sans
Paroles,&#8221; or if I hum to myself a few bars of a
ballad, then sure to be long forgotten by the
world at large, &#8220;Oh, movin' man, don't take
ma baby grand!&#8221; I shall have only to close my
eyes, and wait passively. First Tiffin will come
with the lighted candle: &#8220;Beau temps, monsieur.&#8221;
I shall hear Talbott shouting, &#8220;Rendezvous
two thousand over field. If&mdash;get lost&mdash;better&mdash;home.&#8221;
J.&nbsp;B. will rush up smoking
the cork end of a cigarette. &#8220;I've just had the
adventure of my life!&#8221; And Miller, sitting on
an essence-case, will have lost none of his old
conviction. &#8220;Oh, man! you were fruit salad!
Fruit salad, I tell you! I could have speared
you with my eyes shut!&#8221;</p>

<p>And in those days, happily still far off, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
will be many another old gray-beard with such
memories; unless they are all to wear out their
days uselessly regretting that they are no longer
young, there must be clubs where they may
exchange reminiscences. These need not be
pretentious affairs. Let there be a strong odor
of burnt castor oil and gasoline as you enter the
door; a wide view from the verandas of earth
and sky; maps on the walls; and on the roof
a canvas &#8220;pantaloon-leg&#8221; to catch the wind.
Nothing else matters very much. There they
will be as happy as any old airman can expect
to be, arguing about the winds and disputing
one another's judgment about the height of
the clouds.</p>

<p>If you say to one of them, &#8220;Tell us something
about the Great War,&#8221; as likely as not he will
tell you a pleasant story enough. And the pity
of it will be that, hearing the tale, a young man
will long for another war. Then you must say
to him, &#8220;But what about the shell fire? Tell
us something of machines falling in flames.&#8221;
Then, if he is an honest old airman whose memory
is still unimpaired, the young one who has
been listening will have sober second thoughts.</p>

<h3><a name="A_BALLOON_ATTACK" id="A_BALLOON_ATTACK"></a>A BALLOON ATTACK</h3>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I'm</span> looking for two balloonatics,&#8221; said Talbott,
as he came into the messroom; &#8220;and I
think I've found them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Percy, Talbott's orderly, Tiffin the steward,
Drew, and I were the only occupants of the
room. Percy is an old <i>l&eacute;gionnaire</i>, crippled with
rheumatism. His active service days are over.
Tiffin's working hours are filled with numberless
duties. He makes the beds, and serves
food from three to five times daily to members
of the Escadrille Lafayette. These two being
eliminated, the identity of the balloonatics was
plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;The orders have just come,&#8221; Talbott added,
&#8220;and I decided that the first men I met after
leaving the bureau would be balloonatics. Virtue
has gone into both of you. Now, if you can
make fire come out of a Boche sausage, you will
have done all that is required. Listen. This is
interesting. The orders are in French, but I
will translate as I read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the umteenth day of June, the escadrilles
of Groupe de Combat Blank [that's ours] will
cooperate in an attack on the German observation
balloons along the sector extending from X
to Y. The patrols to be furnished are: (1) two
patrols of protection, of five <i>avions</i> each, by the
escadrilles Spa. 87 and Spa. 12; (2) four patrols
of attack, of three <i>avions</i> each, by the escadrilles
Spa. 124 [that's us], Spa. 93, Spa. 10, and Spa. 12.</p>

<p>The attack will be organized as follows: on the
day set, weather permitting, the two patrols of
protection will leave the field at 10.30 <small>A.M.</small> The
patrol of Spa. 87 will rendezvous over the village
of N&mdash;&mdash;. The patrol of protection of Spa. 12
will rendezvous over the village of C&mdash;&mdash;. At
10.45, precisely, they will start for the lines, crossing
at an altitude of thirty-five hundred metres.
The patrol furnished by Spa. 87 will guard the
sector from X to T, between the town of O&mdash;&mdash;
and the two enemy balloons on that sector.
The patrol furnished by Spa. 12 will guard the
sector from T to Y, between the railway line
and the two enemy balloons on that sector. Immediately
after the attack has been made, these
formations will return to the aerodrome.</p>

<p>At 10.40 <small>A.M.</small> the four patrols of attack will
leave the field, and will rendezvous as follows.
[Here followed the directions.] At 10.55, precisely,
they will start for the lines, crossing at an
approximate altitude of sixteen hundred metres,
each patrol making in a direct line for the balloon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
assigned to it. Numbers 1 and 2 of each of these
patrols will carry rockets. Number 3 will fly immediately
above them, offering further protection
in case of attack by enemy aircraft. Number 1
of each patrol will first attack the balloon. If he
fails, number 2 will attack. If number 1 is successful,
number 2 will then attack the observers in
their parachutes. If number 1 fails, and number
2 is successful, number 3 will attack the observers.
The patrol will then proceed to the aerodrome
by the shortest route.</p>

<p>Squadron commanders will make a return before
noon to-day, of the names of pilots designated
by them for their respective patrols.</p>

<p>In case of unfavorable weather, squadron commanders
will be informed of the date to which the
attack has been postponed.</p>

<p>Pilots designated as numbers 1 and 2 of the
patrols of attack will be relieved from the usual
patrol duty from this date. They will employ
their time at rocket shooting. A target will be in
place on the east side of the field from 1.30 <small>P.M.</small>
to-day.</p></div>

<p>&#8220;Are there any remarks?&#8221; said Talbott, as
if he had been reading the minutes at a debating-club
meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said J.&nbsp;B. &#8220;When is the umteenth
of June?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, mon vieux! that's the question. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
commandant knows, and he isn't telling. Any
other little thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>I suggested that we would like to know which
of us was to be number 1.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right. Drew, how would you like
to be the first rocketeer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I've no objection,&#8221; said J.&nbsp;B., grinning as
if the frenzy of balloonaticking had already
got into his blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right! that's settled. I'll see your mechanicians
about fitting your machines for rockets.
You can begin practice this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Percy had been listening with interest to the
conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got some nice job, you boys. But if you
bring him down, there will be a lot of chuckling
in the trenches. You won't hear it, but
they will all be saying, 'Bravo! &Eacute;patant!' I've
been there. I've seen it and I know. Does
'em all good to see a sausage brought down.
'There's another one of their eyes knocked
out,' they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Percy is right,&#8221; said J.&nbsp;B. as we were walking
down the road. &#8220;Destroying a balloon is
not a great achievement in itself. Of course,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it's so much equipment gone, so much expense
added to the German war-budget. That is
something. But the effect on the infantrymen
is the important thing. Boche soldiers, thousands
of them, will see one of their balloons
coming down in flame. They will be saying,
'Where are our airmen?' like those old poilus
we met at the station when we first came out.
It's bound to influence morale. Now let's see.
The balloon, we will say, is at sixteen hundred
metres. At that height it can be seen by men
on the ground within a radius of&mdash;&#8221; and so
forth and so on.</p>

<p>We figured it out approximately, estimating
the numbers of soldiers, of all branches of service,
who would witness the sight. Multiplying
this number by four, our conclusion was that,
as a result of the expedition, the length of the
war and its outcome might very possibly be
affected. At any rate, there would be such an
ebbing of German morale, and such a flooding
of French, that the way would be opened to a
decisive victory on that front.</p>

<p>But supposing we should miss our sausage?
J.&nbsp;B. grew thoughtful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Have another look at the orders. I don't
remember what the instructions were in case
we both fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>I read, &#8220;If number 1 fails and number 2 is
successful, number 3 will attack the observers.
The patrol will then proceed to the aerodrome
by the shortest route.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was plain enough. Allowance could
be made for one failure, but two&mdash;the possibility
had not even been considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the shortest route.&#8221; There was a piece
of sly humor for you. It may have been unconscious,
but we preferred to believe that the
commandant had chuckled as he dictated it.
A sort of afterthought, as much as to say to his
pilots, &#8220;Well, you young bucks, you would-be
airmen: thought it would be all sport, eh?
You might have known. It's your own fault.
Now go out and attack those balloons. It's
possible that you may have a scrap or two on
your hands while you are at it. Oh, yes, by
the way, coming home, you'll be down pretty
low. Every Boche machine in the air will have
you at a disadvantage. Better return by the
shortest route.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>One feature of the programme did not appeal
to us greatly, and this was the attack to be
made on the observers when they had jumped
with their parachutes. It seemed as near the
border line between legitimate warfare and cold-blooded
murder as anything could well be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are armed with a machine-gun. He
may have an automatic pistol. It will require
from five to ten minutes for him to reach the
ground after he has jumped. You can come
down on him like a stone. Well, it's your job,
thank the Lord! not mine,&#8221; said Drew.</p>

<p>It was my job, but I insisted that he would
be an accomplice. In destroying the balloon,
he would force me to attack the observers.
When I asked Talbott if this feature of the attack
could be eliminated he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I have instructions from the
commandant touching on this point. In case
any pilot objects to attacking the observers
with machine-gun fire, he is to strew their parachutes
with autumn leaves and such field-flowers
as the season affords. Now, listen!
What difference, ethically, is there, between attacking
one observation officer in a parachute,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and dropping a ton of bombs on a train-load of
soldiers? And to kill the observers is really more
important than to destroy the balloon. If you
are going to be a military pilot, for the love of
Pete and Alf be one!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was right, of course, but that didn't
make the prospect any the more pleasant.</p>

<p>The large map at the bureau now had greater
interest for us than ever. The German balloons
along the sector were marked in pictorially,
with an ink line, representing the cable, running
from the basket of each one down to the
exact spot on the map from which they were
launched. Under one of these, &#8220;Spa. 124&#8221;
was printed, neatly, in red ink. It was the
farthest distant from our lines of the four to
be attacked, and about ten kilometres within
German-held territory. The cable ran to the
outskirts of a village situated on a railroad and
a small stream. The location of enemy aviation
fields was also shown pictorially, each one
represented by a minute sketch, very carefully
made, of an Albatross biplane. We noticed
that there were several aerodromes not far
distant from our balloon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>After a survey of the map, the commandant's
afterthought, &#8220;by the shortest route,&#8221;
was not so needless as it appeared at first.
The German positions were in a salient, a large
corner, the line turning almost at right angles.
We could cross them from the south, attack
our balloon, and then, if we wished, return to
French territory on the west side of the salient.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may miss some heavy shelling. If we
double on our tracks going home, they will be
expecting us, of course; whereas, if we go out
on the west side, we will pass over batteries
which didn't see us come in. If there should
happen to be an east wind, there will be another
reason in favor of the plan. The commandant
is a shrewd soldier. It may have been his way
of saying that the longest way round is the
shortest way home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our Spads were ready after luncheon. A
large square of tin had been fastened over the
fabric of each lower wing, under the rocket
fittings, to prevent danger of fire from sparks.
Racks for six rockets, three on a side, had been
fastened to the struts. The rockets were tipped
with sharp steel points to insure their pricking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the silk balloon envelope. The batteries for
igniting them were connected with a button
inside the car, within easy reach of the pilot.
Lieutenant Verdane, our French second-in-command,
was to supervise our practice on
the field. We were glad of this. If we failed
to &#8220;spear our sausage,&#8221; it would not be through
lack of efficient instruction. He explained to
Drew how the thing was to be done. He was
to come on the balloon into the wind, and
preferably not more than four hundred metres
above it. He was to let it pass from view under
the wing; then, when he judged that he was
directly over it, to reduce his motor and dive
vertically, placing the bag within the line of his
two circular sights, holding it there until the
bag just filled the circle. At that second he
would be about 250 metres distant from it, and
it was then that the rockets should be fired.</p>

<p>The instructions were simple enough, but in
practicing on the target we found that they
were not so easy to carry out. It was hard to
judge accurately the moment for diving. Sometimes
we overshot the target, but more often
we were short of it. Owing to the angle at which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the rockets were mounted on the struts, it was
very important that the dive should be vertical.</p>

<p>One morning, the attack could have been
made with every chance of success. Drew and
I left the aerodrome a few minutes before
sunrise for a trial flight, that we might give
our motors a thorough testing. We climbed
through a heavy mist which lay along the
ground like water, filling every fold and hollow,
flowing up the hillsides, submerging everything
but the crests of the highest hills. The tops of
the twin spires of S&mdash;&mdash; cathedral were all that
could be seen of the town. Beyond, the long
chain of heights where the first-line trenches
were rose just clear of the mist, which glowed
blood-red as the sun came up.</p>

<p>The balloons were already up, hanging above
the dense cloud of vapor, elongated planets
drifting in space. The observers were directing
the fire of their batteries to those positions
which stood revealed. Shells were also exploding
on lower ground, for we saw the mist billow upward
time after time with the force of mighty
concussions, and slowly settle again. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
an awe-inspiring sight. We might have been
watching the last battle of the last war that
could ever be, with the world still fighting on,
bitterly, blindly, gradually sinking from sight
in a sea of blood. I have never seen anything
to equal that spectacle of an artillery battle
in the mists.</p>

<p>Conditions were ideal for the attack. We
could have gone to the objective, fired our
rockets, and made our return, without once
having been seen from the ground. It was an
opportunity made in heaven, an Allied heaven.
&#8220;But the infantry would not have seen it,&#8221;
said J.&nbsp;B.; which was true. Not that we cared
to do the thing in a spectacular fashion. We
were thinking of that decisive effect upon
morale.</p>

<p>Two hours later we were pitching pennies in
one of the hangars, when Talbott came across
the field, followed solemnly by Whiskey and
Soda, the lion mascots of the Escadrille Lafayette.</p>

<p>&#8220;What's the date, anybody know?&#8221; he
asked, very casually.</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;B. is an agile-minded youth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It isn't the umteenth by any chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right the first time.&#8221; He looked at his
watch. &#8220;It is now ten past ten. You have
half an hour. Better get your rockets attached.
How are your motors&mdash;all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was one way of breaking the news, and
the best one, I think. If we had been told the
night before, we should have slept badly.</p>

<p>The two patrols of protection left the field
exactly on schedule time. At 10.35, Irving,
Drew, and I were strapped in our machines,
waiting, with our motors turning <i>ralenti</i>, for
Talbott's signal to start.</p>

<p>He was romping with Whiskey. &#8220;Atta boy,
Whiskey! Eat 'em up! Atta ole lion!&#8221;</p>

<p>As a squadron leader Talbott has many virtues,
but the most important of them all is his
casualness. And he is so sincere and natural
in it. He has no conception of the dramatic possibilities
of a situation&mdash;something to be profoundly
thankful for in the commander of an
<i>escadrille de chasse</i>. Situations are dramatic
enough, tense enough, without one's taking
thought of the fact. He might have stood there,
watch in hand, counting off the seconds. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
might have said, &#8220;Remember, we're all counting
on you. Don't let us down. You've got to
get that balloon!&#8221; Instead of that, he glanced
at his watch as if he had just remembered us.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; run along, you sausage-spearers.
We're having lunch at twelve. That will give
you time to wash up after you get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miller, of course, had to have a parting shot.
He had been in hiding somewhere until the
last moment. Then he came rushing up with a
toothbrush and a safety-razor case. He stood
waving them as I taxied around into the wind.
His purpose was to remind me of the possibility
of landing with a <i>panne de moteur</i> in Germany,
and the need I would then have of my toilet
articles.</p>

<p>At 10.54, J.&nbsp;B. came slanting down over me,
then pulled up in <i>ligne de vol</i>, and went straight
for the lines. I fell in behind him at about one
hundred metres distance. Irving was two hundred
metres higher. Before we left the field
he said: &#8220;You are not to think about Germans.
That's my job. I'll warn you if I see that
we are going to be attacked. Go straight for
the balloon. If you don't see me come down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and signal, you will know that there is no
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The French artillery were giving splendid
co&ouml;peration. I saw clusters of shell-explosions
on the ground. The gunners were carrying
out their part of the programme, which was to
register on enemy anti-aircraft batteries as we
passed over them. They must have made good
practice. Anti-aircraft fire was feeble, and, such
of it as there was, very wild.</p>

<p>We came within view of the railway line
which runs from the German lines to a large
town, their most important distributing center
on the sector. Following it along with my eyes
to the halfway point, I saw the red roofs of the
village which we had so often looked at from a
distance. Our balloon was in its usual place.
It looked like a yellow plum, and no larger than
one; but ripe, ready to be plucked.</p>

<p>A burst of flame far to the left attracted my
attention, and almost at the same moment, one
to the right. Ribbons of fire flapped upward
in clouds of black oily smoke. Drew signaled
with his joy-stick, and I knew what he meant:
&#8220;Hooray! two down! It's our turn next!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>&#8221;
But we were still three or four minutes away.
That was unfortunate, for a balloon can be
drawn down with amazing speed.</p>

<p>A rocket sailed into the air and burst in a
point of greenish white light, dazzling in its
brilliancy, even in the full light of day. Immediately
after this two white objects, so small
as to be hardly visible, floated earthward: the
parachutes of the observers. They had jumped.
The balloon disappeared from view behind
Drew's machine. It was being drawn down,
of course, as fast as the motor could wind up
the cable. It was an exciting moment for us.
We were coming on at two hundred kilometres
an hour, racing against time and very
little time at that. &#8220;Sheridan, only five miles
away,&#8221; could not have been more eager for his
journey's end. Our throttles were wide open,
the engines developing their highest capacity
for power.</p>

<p>I swerved out to one side for another glimpse
of the target: it was almost on the ground, and
directly under us. Drew made a steep virage
and dived. I started after him in a tight spiral,
to look for the observers; but they had both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
disappeared. The balloon was swaying from
side to side under the tension of the cable. It
was hard to keep it in view. I lost it under my
wing. Tipping up on the other side, I saw
Drew release his rockets. They spurted out in
long wavering lines of smoke. He missed.
The balloon lay close to the ground, looking
larger, riper than ever. The sight of its smooth,
sleek surface was the most tantalizing of invitations.
Letting it pass under me again, I waited
for a second or two, then shut down the motor,
and pushed forward on the control-stick until
I was falling vertically. Standing upright on
the rudder-bar, I felt the tugging of the shoulder-straps.
Getting the bag well within the
sights, I held it there until it just filled the
circle. Then I pushed the button.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">Although it was only eight o'clock, both Drew
and I were in bed; for we were both very tired,
it was a chilly evening, and we had no fire.
An oil lamp was on the table between the two
cots. Drew was sitting propped up, his fur
coat rolled into a bundle for a back-rest. He
had a sweater, tied by the sleeves, around his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
shoulders. His hands were clasped around his
blanketed knees, and his breath, rising in a
cloud of luminous steam,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Like pious incense from a censer old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed taking flight for heaven without a death.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet, &#8220;pious&#8221; is hardly the word. J.&nbsp;B. was
swearing, drawing from a choice reserve of picturesque
epithets which I did not know that he
possessed. I regret the necessity of omitting
some of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't see how I could have missed it!
Why, I didn't turn to look for at least thirty
seconds. I was that sure that I had brought it
down. Then I banked and nearly fell out of my
seat when I saw it there. I redressed at four
hundred metres. I couldn't have been more
than one hundred metres away when I fired the
rockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Circled around, waiting for you. I had the
balloon in sight all the while you were diving.
It was a great sight to watch from below,
particularly when you let go your rockets.
I'll never forget it, never. But, Lord! Without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the climax! Artistically, it was an awful
fizzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no denying this. A balloon bonfire
was the only possible conclusion to the adventure,
and we both failed at lighting it. I,
too, redressed when very close to the bag,
and made a steep bank in order to escape the
burst of flame from the ignited gas. The rockets
leaped out, with a fine, blood-stirring roar.
The mere sound ought to have been enough to
make any balloon collapse. But when I turned,
there it was, intact, a super-Brobdingnagian
pumpkin, seen at close view, and still ripe, still
ready for plucking. If I live to one hundred
years, I shall never have a greater surprise or a
more bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>There was no leisure for brooding over it
then. My altimeter registered only two hundred
and fifty metres, and the French lines were
far distant. If the motor failed I should have to
land in German territory. Any fate but that.
Nevertheless, I felt in the pocket of my combination,
to be sure that my box of matches was
safely in place. We were cautioned always to
carry them where they could be quickly got at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in case of a forced landing in enemy country.
An airman must destroy his machine in such
an event. But my Spad did not mean to end
its career so ingloriously. The motor ran beautifully,
hitting on every cylinder. We climbed
from two hundred and fifty metres to three
hundred and fifty, four hundred and fifty, and
on steadily upward. In the vicinity of the balloon,
machine-gun fire from the ground had
been fairly heavy; but I was soon out of range,
and saw the tracer bullets, like swarms of blue
bubbles, curving downward again at the end
of their trajectory.</p>

<p>No machines, either French or German, were
in sight. Irving had disappeared some time before
we reached the balloon. I had not seen
Drew from the moment when he fired his rockets.
He waited until he made sure that I was
following, then started for the west side of the
salient. I did not see him, because of my interest
in those clouds of blue bubbles which were
rising with anything but bubble-like tranquillity.
When I was clear of them, I set my course
westward and parallel with the enemy lines to
the south.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>I had never flown so low, so far in German
territory. The temptation to forget precaution
and to make a leisurely survey of the
ground beneath was hard to resist. It was not
wholly resisted, in fact. Anti-aircraft fire was
again feeble and badly ranged. The shells burst
far behind and above, for I was much too low
to offer an easy target. This gave me a dangerous
sense of safety, and so I tipped up on one
side, then on the other, examining the roads,
searching the ruins of villages, the trenches, the
shell-marked ground. I saw no living thing;
brute or human; nothing but endless, inconceivable
desolation.</p>

<p>The foolishness of that close scrutiny alone,
without the protection of other <i>avions</i>, I realize
now much better than I did then. Unless flying
at six thousand metres or above,&mdash;when
he is comparatively safe from attack,&mdash;a pilot
may never relax his vigilance for thirty seconds
together. He must look behind him, below,
above, constantly. All aviators learn this eventually,
but in the case of many new pilots the
knowledge comes too late to be of service. I
thought this was to be my experience, when,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
looking up, I saw five combat machines bearing
down upon me. Had they been enemy planes
my chances would have been very small, for
they were close at hand before I saw them.
The old French aviator, worn out by his five
hundred hours of flight over the trenches, said,
&#8220;Save your nervous energy.&#8221; I exhausted a
three-months reserve in as many seconds. The
suspense, luckily, was hardly longer than that.
It passed when the patrol leader, followed by
the others, pulled up in <i>ligne de vol</i>, about one
hundred metres above me, showing their French
<i>cocardes</i>. It was the group of protection of
Spa. 87. At the time I saw Drew, a quarter
of a mile away. As he turned, the sunlight
glinted along his rocket-tubes.</p>

<p>A crowded hour of glorious life it seems now,
although I was not of this opinion at the time.
In reality, we were absent barely forty minutes.
Climbing out of my machine at the aerodrome,
I looked at my watch. A quarter to twelve.
Laignier, the sergeant mechanician, was sitting
in a sunny corner of the hangar, reading the
&#8220;Matin,&#8221; just as I had left him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Talbott's only comment was:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
&#8220;Don't let it worry you. Better luck next time.
The group bagged two out of four, and Irving
knocked down a Boche who was trying to get
at you. That isn't bad for half an hour's work.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the decisive effect on morale which was
to result from our wholesale destruction of balloons
was diminished by half. We had forced
ours down, but it bobbed up again very soon afterward.
The one-o'clock patrol saw it, higher,
Miller said, than it had ever been. It was Miller,
by the way, who looked in on us at nine o'clock
the same evening. The lamp was out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of us was, but we didn't answer.
He closed the door, then reopened it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It's laziness, that's what it is. They ought
to put you on school r&eacute;gime again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had one more afterthought. Looking in
a third time, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it, you little old human dynamos;
are you getting rusty?&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="BROUGHT_DOWN" id="BROUGHT_DOWN"></a>BROUGHT DOWN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> preceding chapters of this journal have
been written to little purpose if it has not been
made clear that Drew and I, like most pilots
during the first weeks of service at the front,
were worth little to the Allied cause. We were
warned often enough that the road to efficiency
in military aviation is a long and dangerous one.
We were given much excellent advice by aviators
who knew what they were talking about.
Much of this we solicited, in fact, and then
proceeded to disregard it item by item. Eager
to get results, we plunged into our work with
the valor of ignorance, the result being that
Drew was shot down in one of his first encounters,
escaping with his life by one of those more
than miracles for which there is no explanation.
That I did not fare as badly or worse is due
solely to the indulgence of that godfather of
ours, already mentioned, who watched over my
first flights while in a mood beneficently pro-Ally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Drew's adventure followed soon after our
first patrol, when he had the near combat
with the two-seater. Luckily, on that occasion,
both the German pilot and his machine-gunner
were taken completely off their guard. Not
only did he attack with the sun squarely in his
face, but he went down in a long, gradual dive,
in full view of the gunner, who could not have
asked for a better target. But the man was
asleep, and this gave J.&nbsp;B. a dangerous contempt
for all gunners of enemy nationality.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Talbott cautioned him. &#8220;You
have been lucky, but don't get it into your head
that this sort of thing happens often. Now, I'm
going to give you a standing order. You are
not to attack again, neither of you are to think
of attacking, during your first month here. As
likely as not it would be your luck the next time
to meet an old pilot. If you did, I wouldn't
give much for your chances. He would outmaneuver
you in a minute. You will go out on
patrol with the others, of course; it's the only
way to learn to fight. But if you get lost, go
back to our balloons and stay there until it is
time to go home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of us obeyed this order, and, as it
happened, Drew was the one to suffer. A group
of American officers visited the squadron one
afternoon. In courtesy to our guests, it was
decided to send out all the pilots for an additional
patrol, to show them how the thing was
done. Twelve machines were in readiness for
the sortie, which was set for seven o'clock, the
last one of the day. We were to meet at three
thousand metres, and then to divide forces,
one patrol to cover the east half of the sector
and one the west.</p>

<p>We got away beautifully, with the exception
of Drew, who had motor-trouble and was five
minutes late in starting. With his permission
I insert here his own account of the adventure&mdash;a
letter written while he was in hospital.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No doubt you are wondering what happened,
listening, meanwhile, to many I-told-you-so explanations
from the others. This will be hard on
you, but bear up, son. It might not be a bad plan
to listen, with the understanding as well as with
the ear, to some expert advice on how to bag the
Hun. To quote the prophetic Miller, &#8220;I'm telling
you this for your own good.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave my name and the number of the escadrille<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to the medical officer at the <i>poste de secours</i>.
He said he would 'phone the captain at once, so
that you must know before this, that I have been
amazingly lucky. I fell the greater part of two
miles&mdash;count 'em, two!&mdash;before I actually regained
control, only to lose it again. I fainted
while still several hundred feet from the ground;
but more of this later. Couldn't sleep last night.
Had a fever and my brain went on a spree, taking
advantage of my helplessness. I just lay in bed
and watched it function. Besides, there was a great
artillery racket all night long. It appeared to be
coming from our sector, so you must have heard
it as well. This hospital is not very far back and
we get the full orchestral effect of heavy firing.
The result is that I am dead tired to-day. I believe
I can sleep for a week.</p>

<p>They have given me a bed in the officers' ward&mdash;me,
a corporal. It is because I am an American,
of course. Wish there was some way of showing
one's appreciation for so much kindness. My
neighbor on the left is a <i>chasseur</i> captain. A hand-grenade
exploded in his face. He will go through
life horribly disfigured. An old padre, with two
machine-gun bullets in his hip, is on the other side.
He is very patient, but sometimes the pain is
a little too much for him. To a Frenchman, &#8220;Oh,
l&agrave;, l&agrave;!&#8221; is an expression for every conceivable kind
of emotion. In the future it will mean unbearable
physical pain to me. Our orderlies are two <i>poilus</i>,
long past military age. They are as gentle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
thoughtful as the nurses themselves. One of them
brought me lemonade all night long. Worth while
getting wounded just to have something taste so
good.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">I meant to finish this letter a week ago, but
haven't felt up to it. Quite perky this morning,
so I'll go on with the tale of my &#8220;heroic combat.&#8221;
Only, first, tell me how that absurd account of it
got into the &#8220;Herald&#8221;? I hope Talbott knows
that I was not foolish enough to attack six Germans
single-handed. If he doesn't, please enlighten
him. His opinion of my common sense
must be low enough, as it is.</p>

<p>We were to meet over S&mdash;&mdash; at three thousand
metres, you remember, and to cover the sector
at five thousand until dusk. I was late in getting
away, and by the time I reached the rendezvous
you had all gone. There wasn't a chasse machine
in sight. I ought to have gone back to the balloons
as Talbott advised, but thought it would be easy
to pick you up later, so went on alone after I had
got some height. Crossed the lines at thirty-five
hundred metres, and finally got up to four thousand,
which was the best I could do with my rebuilt
engine. The Huns started shelling, but
there were only a few of them that barked. I
went down the lines for a quarter of an hour,
meeting two Sopwiths and a Letord, but no Spads.
You were almost certain to be higher than I, but
my old packet was doing its best at four thousand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and getting overheated with the exertion. Had to
throttle down and <i>pique</i> several times to cool off.</p>

<p>Then I saw you&mdash;at least I thought it was you&mdash;about
four kilometres inside the German lines.
I counted six machines, well grouped, one a good
deal higher than the others and one several hundred
metres below them. The pilot on top was
doing beautiful <i>renversements</i> and an occasional
barrel-turn, in Barry's manner. I was so certain
it was our patrol that I started over at once, to
join you. It was getting dusk and I lost sight of
the machine lowest down for a few seconds.
Without my knowing it, he was approaching at
exactly my altitude. You know how difficult it
is to see a machine in that position. Suddenly he
loomed up in front of me like an express train,
as you have seen them approach from the depths
of a moving-picture screen, only ten times faster;
and he was firing as he came. I realized my awful
mistake, of course. His tracer bullets were going
by on the left side, but he corrected his aim, and
my motor seemed to be eating them up. I banked
to the right, and was about to cut my motor and
dive, when I felt a smashing blow in the left
shoulder. A sickening sensation and a very peculiar
one, not at all what I thought it might feel
like to be hit with a bullet. I believed that it
came from the German in front of me. But it
couldn't have, for he was still approaching when
I was hit, and I have learned here that the bullet
entered from behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the history of less than a minute I'm
giving you. It seemed much longer than that,
but I don't suppose it was. I tried to shut down
the motor, but couldn't manage it because my
left arm was gone. I really believed that it had
been blown off into space until I glanced down
and saw that it was still there. But for any service
it was to me, I might just as well have lost it.
There was a vacant period of ten or fifteen seconds
which I can't fill in. After that I knew that
I was falling, with my motor going full speed.
It was a helpless realization. My brain refused
to act. I could do nothing. Finally, I did have
one clear thought, &#8220;Am I on fire?&#8221; This cut
right through the fog, brought me up broad
awake. I was falling almost vertically, in a sort
of half <i>vrille</i>. No machine but a Spad could have
stood the strain. The Huns were following me
and were not far away, judging by the sound of
their guns. I fully expected to feel another bullet
or two boring its way through. One did cut the
skin of my right leg, although I didn't know this
until I reached the hospital. Perhaps it was well
that I did fall out of control, for the firing soon
stopped, the Germans thinking, and with reason,
that they had bagged me. Some proud Boche
airman is wearing an iron cross on my account.
Perhaps the whole crew of dare-devils has been
decorated. However, no unseemly sarcasm. We
would pounce on a lonely Hun just as quickly.
There is no chivalry in war in these modern days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>I pulled out of the spin, got the broom-stick
between my knees, reached over, and shut down
the motor with my right hand. The propeller
stopped dead. I didn't much care, being very
drowsy and tired. The worst of it was that I
couldn't get my breath. I was gasping as though
I had been hit in the pit of the stomach. Then
I lost control again and started falling. It was
awful! I was almost ready to give up. I believe
that I said, out loud, &#8220;I'm going to be killed.
This is my last sortie.&#8221; At any rate, I thought it.
Made one last effort and came out in <i>ligne de vol</i>,
as nearly as I could judge, about one hundred
and fifty metres from the ground. It was an ugly-looking
place for landing, trenches and shell-holes
everywhere. I was wondering in a vague way
whether they were French or German, when I fell
into the most restful sleep I've ever had in my life.</p>

<p>I have no recollection of the crash, not the
slightest. I might have fallen as gently as a leaf.
That is one thing to be thankful for among a good
many others. When I came to, it was at once,
completely. I knew that I was on a stretcher and
remembered immediately exactly what had happened.
My heart was going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat,
and I could hardly breathe, but I had no sensation
of pain except in my chest. This made me
think that I had broken every bone in my body.
I tried moving first one leg, then the other, then
my arms, my head, my body. No trouble at all,
except with my left arm and side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>I accepted the miracle without attempting to
explain it, for I had something more important
to wonder about: who had the handles of my
stretcher? The first thing I did was to open my
eyes, but I was bleeding from a scratch on the
forehead and saw only a red blur. I wiped them
dry with my sleeve and looked again. The broad
back in front of me was covered with mud. Impossible
to distinguish the color of the tunic. But
the shrapnel helmet above it was&mdash;French! I
was in French hands. If ever I live long enough
in one place, so that I may gather a few possessions
and make a home for myself, on one wall of
my living-room I will have a bust-length portrait,
rear view, of a French <i>brancardier</i>, mud-covered
back and battered tin hat.</p>

<p>Do you remember our walk with M&eacute;nault in
the rain, and the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> at the restaurant where
they made such wonderful omelettes? I am sure
that you will recall the occasion, although you
may have forgotten the conversation. I have
not forgotten one remark of M&eacute;nault's apropos
of talk about risks. If a man were willing, he said,
to stake everything for it, he would accumulate
an experience of fifteen or twenty minutes which
would compensate him, a thousand times over,
for all the hazard. &#8220;And if you live to be old,&#8221;
he said quaintly, &#8220;you can never be bored with
life. You will have something, always, very pleasant
to think about.&#8221; I mention this in connection
with my discovery that I was not in German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
hands. I have had five minutes of perfect happiness
without any background&mdash;no thought of
yesterday or to-morrow&mdash;to spoil it.</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;Bonjour, messieurs,&#8221; in a gurgling
voice. The man in front turned his head sidewise
and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tiens! &Ccedil;a va, monsieur l'aviateur?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other one said, &#8220;Ah, mon vieux!&#8221; You
know the inflection they give this expression, particularly
when it means, &#8220;This is something wonderful!&#8221;
He added that they had seen the combat
and my fall, and little expected to find the pilot
living, to say nothing of speaking. I hoped that
they would go on talking, but I was being carried
along a trench; they had to lift me shoulder-high
at every turn, and needed all their energy. The
Germans were shelling the lines. Several fell
fairly close, and they brought me down a long
flight of wooden steps into a dugout to wait until
the worst of it should be over. While waiting, they
told me that I had fallen just within the first-line
trenches, at a spot where a slight rise in ground
hid me from sight of the enemy. Otherwise,
they might have had a bad time rescuing me.
My Spad was completely wrecked. It fell squarely
into a trench, the wings breaking the force of the
fall. Before reaching the ground, I turned, they
said, and was making straight for Germany.
Fifty metres higher, and I would have come down
in No Man's Land.</p>

<p>For a long time we listened in silence to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
subdued <i>crr-ump</i>, <i>crr-ump</i>, of the shells. Sometimes
showers of earth pattered down the stairway,
and we would hear the high-pitched, droning
<i>V-z-z-z</i> of pieces of shell-casing as they
whizzed over the opening. One of them would
say, &#8220;Not far, that one&#8221;; or, &#8220;He's looking for
some one, that fellow,&#8221; in a voice without a hint
of emotion. Then, long silences and other deep,
earth-shaking rumbles.</p>

<p>They asked me, several times, if I was suffering,
and offered to go on to the <i>poste de secours</i> if
I wanted them to. It was not heavy bombardment,
but it would be safer to wait for a little while.
I told them that I was ready to go on at any time,
but not to hurry on my account; I was quite
comfortable.</p>

<p>The light glimmering down the stairway faded
out and we were in complete darkness. My
brain was amazingly clear. It registered every
trifling impression. I wish it might always be so
intensely awake and active. There seemed to be
four of us in the dugout; the two <i>brancardiers</i>,
and this second self of mine, as curious as an
eavesdropper at a keyhole, listening intently to
everything, and then turning to whisper to me.
The <i>brancardiers</i> repeated the same comments
after every explosion. I thought: &#8220;They have
been saying this to each other for over three
years. It has become automatic. They will never
be able to stop.&#8221; I was feverish, perhaps. If it
was fever, it burned away any illusions I may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
had of modern warfare from the infantryman's
viewpoint. I know that there is no glamour in it
for them; that it has long since become a deadly
monotony, an endless repetition of the same kinds
of horror and suffering, a boredom more terrible
than death itself, which is repeating itself in the
same ways, day after day and month after month.
It isn't often that an aviator has the chance I've
had. It would be a good thing if they were to send
us into the trenches for twenty-four hours, every
few months. It would make us keener fighters,
more eager to do our utmost to bring the war to
an end for the sake of those <i>poilus</i>.</p>

<p>The dressing-station was in a very deep dugout,
lighted by candles. At a table in the center of the
room the medical officer was working over a man
with a terribly crushed leg. Several others were
sitting or lying along the wall, awaiting their
turn. They watched every movement he made in
an apprehensive, animal way, and so did I. They
put me on the table next, although it was not my
turn. I protested, but the doctor paid no attention.
&#8220;Aviateur am&eacute;ricain,&#8221; again. It's a pity
that Frenchmen can't treat us Americans as though
we belong here.</p>

<p>As soon as the doctor had finished with me, my
stretcher was fastened to a two-wheeled carrier
and we started down a cobbled road to the ambulance
station. I was light-headed and don't remember
much of that part of the journey. Had
to take refuge in another dugout when the Huns<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
dropped a shell on an ammunition-dump in a
village through which we were to pass. There
was a deafening banging and booming for a long
time, and when we did go through the town it
was on the run. The whole place was in flames
and small-arms ammunition still exploding. I
remember seeing a long column of soldiers going
at the double in the opposite direction, and they
were in full marching order.</p>

<p>Well, this is the end of the tale; all of it, at any
rate, in which you would be interested. It was
one o'clock in the morning before I got between
cool, clean sheets, and I was wounded about a
quarter past eight. I have been tired ever since.</p>

<p>There is another aviator here, a Frenchman,
who broke his jaw and both legs in a fall while
returning from a night bombardment. His bed is
across the aisle from mine; he has a formidable-looking
apparatus fastened on his head and under
his chin, to hold his jaw firm until the bones knit.
He is forbidden to talk, but breaks the rule whenever
the nurse leaves the ward. He speaks a little
English and has told me a delightful story about
the origin of aerial combat. A French pilot, a
friend of his, he says, attached to a certain army
group during August and September, 1914, often
met a German aviator during his reconnaissance
patrols. In those Arcadian days, fighting in the
air was a development for the future, and these
two pilots exchanged greetings, not cordially,
perhaps, but courteously: a wave of the hand, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
much as to say, &#8220;We are enemies, but we need
not forget the civilities.&#8221; Then they both went
about their work of spotting batteries, watching
for movements of troops, etc. One morning the
German failed to return the salute. The Frenchman
thought little of this, and greeted him in the
customary manner at their next meeting. To his
surprise, the Boche shook his fist at him in the
most blustering and caddish way. There was no
mistaking the insult. They had passed not fifty
metres from each other, and the Frenchman distinctly
saw the closed fist. He was saddened by
the incident, for he had hoped that some of the
ancient courtesies of war would survive in the
aerial branch of the service, at least. It angered
him too; therefore, on his next reconnaissance,
he ignored the German. Evidently the Boche
air-squadrons were being Prussianized. The enemy
pilot approached very closely and threw a
missile at him. He could not be sure what it was,
as the object went wide of the mark; but he was so
incensed that he made a <i>virage</i>, and drawing a
small flask from his pocket, hurled it at his boorish
antagonist. The flask contained some excellent
port, he said, but he was repaid for the loss in
seeing it crash on the exhaust-pipe of the enemy
machine.</p>

<p>This marked the end of courtesy and the beginning
of active hostilities in the air. They were
soon shooting at each other with rifles, automatic
pistols, and at last with machine guns. Later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
developments we know about. The night bombarder
has been telling me this yarn in serial
form. When the nurse is present, he illustrates
the last chapter by means of gestures. I am ready
to believe everything but the incident about the
port. That doesn't sound plausible. A Frenchman
would have thrown his watch before making
such a sacrifice!</p></div>

<h3><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_HOURS" id="ONE_HUNDRED_HOURS"></a>ONE HUNDRED HOURS</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> more than a year after our first meeting
in the Paris restaurant which has so many
pleasant memories for us, Drew completed his
first one hundred hours of flight over the lines,
an event in the life of an airman which calls for
a celebration of some sort. Therefore, having
been granted leave for the afternoon, the two
of us came into the old French town of Bar-le-Duc,
by the toy train which wanders down
from the Verdun sector. We had dinner in one
of those homelike little places where the food
is served by the proprietor himself. On this
occasion it was served hurriedly, and the bill
presented promptly at eight o'clock. Our host
was very sorry, but &#8220;les sales Boches, vous
savez, messieurs?&#8221; They had come the night
before: a dozen houses destroyed, women and
children killed and maimed. With a full moon
to guide them, they would be sure to return
to-night. &#8220;Ah, cette guerre! Quand sera-t-elle
finie?&#8221; He offered us a refuge until our train<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
should leave. Usually, he said, he played
solitaire while waiting for the Germans, but
with houses tumbling about one's ears, he
much preferred company. &#8220;And my wife and
I are old people. She is very deaf, heureusement.
She hears nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;B. declined the invitation. &#8220;A brave way
that would be to finish our evening!&#8221; he said
as we walked down the silent street. &#8220;I wanted
to say, 'Monsieur, I have just finished my first
one hundred hours of flight at the front.' But
he wouldn't have known what that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;No, he wouldn't have known.&#8221;
Then we had no further talk for about two
hours. A few soldiers, late arrivals, were prowling
about in the shadow of the houses, searching
for food and a warm kitchen where they
might eat it. Some insistent ones pounded on
the door of a restaurant far in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dites donc, patron! Nous avons faim, nom
de Dieu! Est-ce-que tout le monde est mort ici?&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;Only a host of phantom listeners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dwelt in the lone house then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that voice from the world of men.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It was that kind of silence, profound, tense,
ghostlike. We walked through street after
street, from one end of the town to the other,
and saw only one light, a faint glimmer which
came from a slit of a cellar window almost on
the level of the pavement. We were curious,
no doubt. At any rate, we looked in. A woman
was sitting on a cot bed with her arms around
two little children. They were snuggled up
against her and both fast asleep; but she was
sitting very erect, in a strained, listening attitude,
staring straight before her. Since that
night we have believed, both of us, that if wars
can be won only by haphazard night bombardments
of towns where there are women and
children, then they had far better be lost.</p>

<p>But I am writing a journal of high adventure
of a cleaner kind, in which all the resources in
skill and cleverness of one set of men are pitted
against those of another set. We have no bomb-dropping
to do, and there are but few women
and children living in the territory over which
we fly. One hundred hours is not a great while
as time is measured on the ground, but in
terms of combat patrols, the one hundredth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
part of it has held more of an adventure in the
true meaning of the word than we have had
during the whole of our lives previously.</p>

<p>At first we were far too busy learning the rudiments
of combat to keep an accurate record
of flying time. We thought our aeroplane clocks
convenient pieces of equipment rather than
necessary ones. I remember coming down from
my first air battle and the breathless account
I gave of it at the bureau, breathless and vague.
Lieutenant Talbott listened quietly, making
out the <i>compte rendu</i> as I talked. When I had
finished, he emphasized the haziness of my answers
to his questions by quoting them: &#8220;Region:
'You know, that big wood!' Time: 'This
morning, of course!' Rounds fired: 'Oh, a
lot!'&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Not until we had been flying for a month or
more did we learn how to make the right use
of our clocks and of our eyes while in the air.
We listened with amazement to after-patrol
talk at the mess. We learned more of what
actually happened on our sorties, after they
were over than while they were in progress.
All of the older pilots missed seeing nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
which there was to see. They reported the numbers
of the enemy planes encountered, the
types, where seen and when. They spotted
batteries, trains in stations back of the enemy
lines, gave the hour precisely, reported any activity
on the roads. In moments of exasperation
Drew would say, &#8220;I think they are stringing
us! This is all a put-up job!&#8221; Certainly
this did appear to be the case at first. For we
were air-blind. We saw little of the activity
all around us, and details on the ground had no
significance. How were we to take thought of
time and place and altitude, note the peculiarities
of enemy machines, count their numbers,
and store all this information away in memory
at the moment of combat? This was a great
problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I need,&#8221; J.&nbsp;B. used to say, &#8220;is a traveling
private secretary. I'll do the fighting and
he can keep the diary.&#8221;</p>

<p>I needed one, too, a man air-wise and battle-wise,
who could calmly take note of my clock,
altimeter, temperature and pressure dials, identify
exactly the locality on my map, count the
numbers of the enemy, estimate their approximate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
altitude,&mdash;all this when the air was
criss-crossed with streamers of smoke from
machine-gun tracer bullets, and opposing aircraft
were maneuvering for position, diving
and firing at each other, spiraling, nose-spinning,
wing-slipping, climbing, in a confusing
intermingling of tricolor cocards and black
crosses.</p>

<p>We made gradual progress, the result being
that our patrols became a hundred-fold more
fascinating, sometimes, in fact, too much so.
It was important that we should be able to
read the ground, but more important still to
remember that what was happening there was
only of secondary concern to us. Often we became
absorbed in watching what was taking
place below us, to the exclusion of any thought
of aerial activity, our chances for attack or of
being attacked. The view, from the air, of a
heavy bombardment, or of an infantry attack
under cover of barrage fires, is a truly terrible
spectacle, and in the air one has a feeling of
detachment which is not easily overcome.</p>

<p>Yet it must be overcome, as I have said,
and cannot say too many times for the benefit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of any young airman who may read this journal.
During an offensive the air swarms with
planes. They are at all altitudes, from the lowest
artillery <i>r&eacute;glage</i> machines at a few hundreds
of metres, to the highest <i>avions de chasse</i> at six
thousand meters and above. <i>R&eacute;glage</i>, photographic,
and reconnaissance planes have their
particular work to do. They defend themselves
as best they can, but almost never attack.
Combat <i>avions</i>, on the other hand; are always
looking for victims. They are the ones chiefly
dangerous to the unwary pursuit pilot.</p>

<p>Drew's first official victory came as the result
of a one-sided battle with an Albatross
single-seater, whose pilot evidently did not
know there was an enemy within miles of him.
No more did J.&nbsp;B. for that matter. &#8220;It was
pure accident,&#8221; he told me afterward. He had
gone from Rheims to the Argonne forest without
meeting a single German. &#8220;And I didn't
want to meet one; for it was Thanksgiving Day.
It has associations for me, you know. I'm a
New Englander.&#8221; It is not possible to convince
him that it has any real significance for
men who were not born on the North Atlantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
seaboard. Well, all the way he had been
humming</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Over the river and through the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grandfather's house we go,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">to himself. It is easy to understand why he
didn't want to meet a German. He must
have been in a curiously mixed frame of mind.
He covered the sector again and passed over
Rheims, going northeast. Then he saw the
Albatross; &#8220;and if you had been standing on
one of the towers of the cathedral you would
have seen a very unequal battle.&#8221; The German
was about two kilometres inside his own
lines, and at least a thousand metres below.
Drew had every advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn't see me until I opened fire, and
then, as it happened, it was too late. My gun
didn't jam!&#8221;</p>

<p>The German started falling out of control,
Drew following him down until he lost sight of
him in making a <i>virage</i>.</p>

<p>I leaned against the canvas wall of a hangar,
registering incredulity. Three times out of
seven, to make a conservative estimate, we
fight inconclusive battles because of faulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
machine guns or defective ammunition. The
ammunition, most of it that is bad, comes from
America.</p>

<p>While Drew was giving me the details, an
orderly from the bureau brought word that an
enemy machine had just been reported shot
down on our sector. It was Drew's Albatross,
but he nearly lost official credit for having destroyed
it, because he did not know exactly the
hour when the combat occurred. His watch
was broken and he had neglected asking for
another before starting. He judged the time
of the attack, approximately, as two-thirty,
and the infantry observers, reporting the result,
gave it as twenty minutes to three. The
region in both cases coincided exactly, however,
and, fortunately, Drew's was the only combat
which had taken place in that vicinity during
the afternoon.</p>

<p>For an hour after his return he was very
happy. He had won his first victory, always
the hardest to gain, and had been complimented
by the commandant, by Lieutenant Nungesser,
the <i>Roi des Aces</i>, and by other French and American
pilots. There is no petty jealousy among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
airmen, and in our group the <i>esprit de corps</i> is
unusually fine. Rivalry is keen, but each
squadron takes almost as much pride in the
work of the other squadrons as it does in its
own.</p>

<p>The details of the result were horrible. The
Albatross broke up two thousand metres from
the ground, one wing falling within the French
lines. Drew knew what it meant to be wounded
and falling out of control. But his Spad held
together. He had a chance for his life. Supposing
the German to have been merely
wounded&mdash;An airman's joy in victory is a
short-lived one.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a curious change takes place
in his attitude toward his work, as the months
pass. I can best describe it in terms of Drew's
experience and my own. We came to the front
feeling deeply sorry for ourselves, and for all
airmen of whatever nationality, whose lives
were to be snuffed out in their promising beginnings.
I used to play &#8220;The Minstrel Boy to
the War Has Gone&#8221; on a tin flute, and Drew
wrote poetry. While we were waiting for our
first machine, he composed &#8220;The Airman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Rendezvous,&#8221; written in the manner of Alan
Seeger's poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;And I in the wide fields of air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must keep with him my rendezvous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be I shall meet him there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When clouds, like sheep, move slowly through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pathless meadows of the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their cool shadows go beneath,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have a rendezvous with Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some summer noon of white and blue.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is more of it, in the same manner, all
of which he read me in a husky voice. I, too,
was ready to weep at our untimely fate. The
strange thing is that his prophecy came so very
near being true. He had the first draft of the
poem in his breast-pocket when wounded, and
has kept the gory relic to remind him&mdash;not
that he needs reminding&mdash;of the airy manner
in which he canceled what ought to have been
a <i>bona-fide</i> appointment.</p>

<p>I do not mean to reflect in any way upon
Alan Seeger's beautiful poem. Who can doubt
that it is a sincere, as well as a perfect, expression
of a mood common to all young soldiers?
Drew was just as sincere in writing his verses,
and I put all the feeling I could into my tin-whistle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
interpretation of &#8220;The Minstrel Boy.&#8221;
What I want to make clear is, that a soldier's
moods of self-pity are fleeting ones, and if he
lives, he outgrows them.</p>

<p>Imagination is an especial curse to an airman,
particularly if it takes a gloomy or morbid turn.
We used to write &#8220;To whom it may concern&#8221;
letters before going out on patrol, in which we
left directions for the notification of our relatives
and the disposal of our personal effects in
case of death. Then we would climb into our
machines thinking, &#8220;This may be our last
sortie. We may be dead in an hour, in half an
hour, in twenty minutes.&#8221; We planned splendidly
spectacular ways in which we were to be
brought down, always omitting one, however,
the most horrible as well as the most common,&mdash;in
flames. Thank Fortune, we have outgrown
this second and belated period of adolescence
and can now take a healthy interest in
our work.</p>

<p>Now, an inevitable part of the daily routine
is to be shelled, persistently, methodically, and
often accurately shelled. Our interest in this
may, I suppose, be called healthy, inasmuch as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it would be decidedly unhealthy to become indifferent
to the activities of the German anti-aircraft
gunners. It would be far-fetched to
say that any airman ever looks forward zestfully
to the business of being shot at with one
hundred and fives; and seventy-fives, if they
are well placed, are unpleasant enough. After
one hundred hours of it, we have learned to
assume that attitude of contemptuous toleration
which is the manner common to all <i>pilotes
de chasse</i>. We know that the chances of a direct
hit are almost negligible, and that we have all
the blue dome of the heavens in which to
maneuver.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have learned many little
tricks by means of which we can keep the
gunners guessing. By way of illustration, we
are patrolling, let us say, at thirty-five hundred
metres, crossing and recrossing the lines, following
the patrol leader, who has his motor
throttled down so that we may keep well in
formation. The guns may be silent for the
moment, but we know well enough what the
gunners are doing. We know exactly where
some of the batteries are, and the approximate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
location of all of them along the sector; and we
know, from earlier experience, when we come
within range of each individual battery. Presently
one of them begins firing in bursts of
four shells. If their first estimate of our range
has been an accurate one, if they place them
uncomfortably close, so that we can hear, all
too well, above the roar of our motors, the rending
<i>Gr-r-rOW</i>, <i>Gr-r-rOW</i>, of the shells as they
explode, we sail calmly&mdash;to all outward appearances&mdash;on,
maneuvering very little. The
gunners, seeing that we are not disturbed, will
alter their ranges, four times out of five, which
is exactly what we want them to do.</p>

<p>The next bursts will be hundreds of metres
below or above us, whereupon we show signs
of great uneasiness, and the gunners, thinking
they have our altitude, begin to fire like demons.
We employ our well-earned immunity in preparing
for the next series of batteries, or in
thinking of the cost to Germany, at one hundred
francs a shot, of all this futile shelling.
Drew, in particular, loves this cost-accounting
business, and I must admit that much pleasure
may be had in it, after patrol. They rarely fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
less than fifty shells at us during a two-hour
patrol. Making a low general average, the number
is nearer one hundred and fifty. On our
present front, where aerial activity is fairly
brisk and the sector is a large one, three or four
hundred shells are wasted upon us often before
we have been out an hour.</p>

<p>We have memories of all the good batteries
from Flanders to the Vosges Mountains. Battery
after battery, we make their acquaintance
along the entire sector, wherever we go. Many
of them, of course, are mobile, so that we never
lose the sport of searching for them. Only a
few days ago we located one of this kind which
came into action in the open by the side of a
road. First we saw the flashes and then the
shell-bursts in the same cadence. We tipped up
and fired at him in bursts of twenty to thirty
rounds, which is the only way airmen have of
passing the time of day with their friends, the
enemy anti-aircraft gunners, who ignore the art
of <i>camouflage</i>.</p>

<p>But we can converse with them, after a
fashion, even though we do not know their
exact position. It will be long before this chapter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of my journal is in print. Having given no
indication of the date of writing, I may say,
without indiscretion, that we are again on the
Champagne front. We have a wholesome respect
for one battery here, a respect it has
justly earned by shooting which is really remarkable.
We talk of this battery, which is
east of Rheims and not far distant from Nogent
l'Abbesse, and take professional pride in keeping
its gunners in ignorance of their fine marksmanship.
We signal them their bad shots&mdash;which
are better than the good ones of most of
the batteries on the sector&mdash;by doing stunts,
a barrel turn, a loop, two or three turns of a
<i>vrille</i>.</p>

<p>As for their good shots, they are often so very
good that we are forced into acrobacy of a
wholly individual kind. Our <i>avions</i> have received
many scars from their shells. Between
forty-five hundred and five thousand metres,
their bursts have been so close under us that
we have been lifted by the concussions and set
down violently again at the bottom of the vacuum;
and this on a clear day when a <i>chasse</i>
machine is almost invisible at that height, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
despite its speed of two hundred kilometres
an hour. On a gray day, when we are flying
between twenty-five hundred and three thousand
metres beneath a film of cloud, they repay
the honor we do them by our acrobatic
turns. They bracket us, put barrages between
us and our own lines, give us more trouble than
all the other batteries on the sector combined.</p>

<p>For this reason it is all the more humiliating
to be forced to land with motor trouble, just
at the moment when they are paying off some
old scores. This happened to Drew while I
have been writing up my journal. Coming out
of a tonneau in answer to three <i>coups</i> from the
battery, his propeller stopped dead. By planing
flatly (the wind was dead ahead, and the
area back of the first lines there is a wide one,
crossed by many intersecting lines of trenches)
he got well over them and chose a field as level
as a billiard table for landing-ground. In the
very center of it, however, there was one post,
a small worm-eaten thing, of the color of the
dead grass around it. He hit it, just as he was
setting his Spad on the ground, the only post
in a field acres wide, and it tore a piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
fabric from one of his lower wings. No doubt
the crack battery has been given credit for disabling
an enemy plane. The honor, such as it
is, belongs to our aerial godfather, among whose
lesser vices may be included that of practical
joking.</p>

<p>The remnants of the post were immediately
confiscated for firewood by some <i>poilus</i> who
were living in a dugout near by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> French attack which has been in preparation
for the past month is to begin at dawn to-morrow.
It has been hard, waiting, but it must
have been a great deal worse for the infantrymen
who are billeted in all of the surrounding
villages. They are moving up to-night to the
first lines, for these are the shock troops who
are to lead the attack. They are chiefly regiments
of Chasseurs&mdash;small men in stature,
but clean, hard, well-knit&mdash;splendid types.
They talk of the attack confidently. It is an
inspiration to listen to them. Hundreds of
them have visited our aerodrome during the
past week, mainly, I think, for a glimpse of
Whiskey and Soda, our lions, who are known
to French soldiers from one end of the line to
the other. Whiskey is almost full-grown, and
Soda about the size of a wild cat. They have
the freedom of the camp and run about everywhere.</p>

<p>The guns are thundering at a terrific rate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the concussions shaking our barracks and
rattling the dishes on the table. In the messroom
the gramophone is playing, &#8220;I'm going
'way back home and have a wonderful time.&#8221;
Music at the front is sometimes a doubtful
blessing.</p>

<p>We are keyed up, some of us, rather nervous
in anticipation of to-morrow. Porter is trying
to give Irving a light from his own cigarette.
Irving, who doesn't know the meaning of
nerves, asks him who in hell he is waving at.
Poor old Porter! His usefulness as a combat
pilot has long past, but he hangs on, doing the
best he can. He should have been sent to the
rear months ago.</p>

<p>The first phase of the battle is over. The
French have taken eleven thousand prisoners,
and have driven the enemy from all the hills
down to the low ground along the canal. For
the most part, we have been too high above
them to see the infantry actions; but knowing
the plans and the objectives beforehand, we
have been able to follow, quite closely, the
progress of the battle.</p>

<p>It opened on a wet morning with the clouds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
very low. We were to have gone on patrol
immediately the attack commenced, but this
was impossible. About nine o'clock the rain
stopped, and Rodman and Davis were sent out
to learn weather conditions over the lines. They
came back with the report that flying was possible
at two hundred metres. This was too low
an altitude to serve any useful purpose, and
the commandant gave us orders to stand by.</p>

<p>About noon the clouds began to break up,
and both high and low patrols prepared to leave
the ground. Drew, Dunham, and I were on
high patrol, with Lieutenant Barry leading.
Our orders were to go up through the clouds,
using them as cover for making surprise attacks
upon enemy <i>r&eacute;glage</i> machines. We were also to
attack any enemy formations sighted within
three kilometres of their old first lines. The
clouds soon disappeared and so we climbed to
forty-five hundred metres and lay in wait for
combat patrols.</p>

<p>Barry sighted one and signaled. Before I
had placed it, he dived, almost full motor, I
believe, for he dropped like a stone. We went
down on his tail and saw him attack the topmost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of three Albatross single-seaters. The
other two dived at once, far into their own lines.
Dunham, Drew, and I took long shots at them,
but they were far outside effective range. The
topmost German made a feeble effort to maneuver
for position. Barry made a <i>renversement</i>
with the utmost nicety of judgment and came
out of it about thirty metres behind and above
the Albatross. He fired about twenty shots,
when the German began falling out of control,
spinning round and round, then diving straight,
then past the vertical, so that we could see the
silver under-surface of his wings and tail, spinning
again until we lost sight of him.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This combat was seen from the ground, and Barry's
victory was confirmed before we returned to the field.</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Talbott joined us as we were
taking our height again. He took command of
the patrol and Barry went off hunting by himself,
as he likes best to do. There were planes
everywhere, of both nationalities. Mounting to
four thousand metres within our own lines, we
crossed over again, and at that moment I saw
a Letord, a three-passenger <i>r&eacute;glage</i> machine,
burst into flames and fall. There was no time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>either to watch or to think of this horrible sight.
We encountered a patrol of five Albatross planes
almost on our level. Talbott dived at once. I
was behind him and picked a German who was
spiraling either upward or downward, for a few
seconds I was not sure which. It was upward.
He was climbing to offer combat. This was
disconcerting. It always is to a green pilot.
If your foe is running, you may be sure he is
at least as badly rattled as you are. If he is a
single-seater and climbing, you may be equally
certain that he is not a novice, and that he has
plenty of sand. Otherwise he would not accept
battle at a disadvantage in the hope of having
his inning next.</p>

<p>I was foolish enough to begin firing while
still about three hundred metres distant. My
opponent ungraciously offered the poorest kind
of a target, getting out of the range of my
sights by some very skillful maneuvering. I
didn't want him to think that he had an inexperienced
pilot to deal with. Therefore, judging
my distance very carefully, I did a <i>renversement</i>
in the Lieutenant Barry fashion. But it
was not so well done. Instead of coming out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of it above and behind the German, when I
pulled up in <i>ligne de vol</i> I was under him!</p>

<p>I don't know exactly what happened then,
but the next moment I was falling in a <i>vrille</i>
(spinning nose dive) and heard the well-known
crackling sound of machine-gun fire. I kept
on falling in a <i>vrille</i>, thinking this would give
the German the poorest possible target.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A mistake which many new pilots make. In a <i>vrille</i>, the
machine spins pretty nearly on its own axis, and although
it is turning, a skillful pilot above it can keep it fairly well
within the line of his sights.</p></div>

<p>Pulling up in <i>ligne de vol</i> I looked over my
shoulder again. The German had lost sight of
me for a moment in the swiftness of his dive,
but evidently he saw me just before I pulled
out of the <i>vrille</i>. He was turning up for another
shot, in exactly the same position in which I
had last seen him. And he was very close, not
more than fifty metres distant.</p>

<p>I believed, of course, that I was lost; and why
that German didn't bag me remains a mystery.
Heaven knows I gave him opportunity enough!
In the end, by the merciful intervention of
Chance, our godfather, I escaped. I have said
that the sky had cleared. But there was one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>strand of cloud left, not very broad, not very
long; but a refuge,&mdash;oh! what a welcome
refuge! It was right in my path and I tumbled
into it, literally, head over heels. I came skidding
out, but pulled up, put on my motor,
and climbed back at once; and I kept turning
round and round in it for several minutes. If
the German had waited, he must have seen me
raveling it out like a cat tangled in a ball of
cotton. I thought that he was waiting. I even
expected him to come nosing into it, in search
of me. In that case there would have been a
glorious smash, for there wasn't room for two
of us. I almost hoped that he would try this.
If I couldn't bag a German with my gun, the
next best thing was to run into him and so be
gathered to my fathers while he was being
gathered to his. There was no crash, and taking
sudden resolution, I dived vertically out of
the cloud, head over shoulder, expecting to see
my relentless foe. He was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>In that wild tumble, and while chasing my
tail in the cloud, I lost my bearings. The compass,
which was mounted on a swinging holder,
had been tilted upside down. It stuck in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
position. I could not get it loose. I had fallen
to six hundred metres, so that I could not get a
large view of the landscape. Under the continuous
bombardment the air was filled with smoke,
and through it nothing looked familiar. I knew
the direction of our lines by the position of the
sun, but I was in a suspicious mood. My motor,
which I had praised to the heavens to the other
pilots, had let me down at a critical moment.
The sun might be ready to play some fantastic
trick. I had to steer by it, although I was uneasy
until I came within sight of our observation
balloons. I identified them as French by
sailing close to one of them so that I could see
the tricolor pennant floating out from a cord
on the bag.</p>

<p>Then, being safe, I put my old Spad through
every antic we two had ever done together.
The observers in the balloons must have
thought me crazy, a pilot running amuck from
aerial shell shock. I had discovered a new
meaning for that &#8220;grand and glorious feeling&#8221;
which is so often the subject of Briggs's cartoons.</p>

<p>Looking at my watch I received the same old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
start of surprise upon learning how much of
wisdom one may accumulate in a half-hour of
aerial adventure. I had still an hour and a half
to get through with before I could go home with
a clear conscience. Therefore, taking height
again, I went cautiously, gingerly, watchfully,
toward the lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &#8220;grand and glorious feeling&#8221; is one of the
finest compensations for this uncertain life in
the air. One has it every time he turns from the
lines toward&mdash;home! It comes in richer glow,
if hazardous work has been done, after moments
of strain, uncertainty, when the result of
a combat sways back and forth; and it gushes
up like a fountain, when, after making a forced
landing in what appears to be enemy territory,
you find yourself among friends.</p>

<p>Late this afternoon we started, four of us,
with Davis as leader, to make the usual two-hour
sortie over the lines. No Germans were
sighted, and after an uneventful half-hour,
Davis, who is always springing these surprises,
decided to stalk them in their lairs. The clouds
were at the right altitude for this, and there
were gaps in them over which we could hover,
examining roads, railroads, villages, cantonments.
The danger of attack was negligible.
We could easily escape any large hostile patrol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
by dodging into the clouds. But the wind was
unfavorable for such a reconnaissance. It was
blowing into Germany. We would have it dead
against us on the journey home.</p>

<p>We played about for a half-hour, blown by a
strong wind farther into Germany than we
knew. We walked down the main street of a
village where we saw a large crowd of German
soldiers, spraying bullets among them, then
climbed into the clouds before a shot could be
fired at us. Later we nearly attacked a hospital,
mistaking it for an aviation field. It was
housed in <i>bessonneau</i> hangars, and had none of
the marks of a hospital excepting a large red
cross in the middle of the field. Fortunately
we saw this before any of us had fired, and
passed on over it at a low altitude to attack a
train. There is a good deal of excitement in an
expedition of this kind, and soldiers themselves
say that surprise sorties from the air have a
demoralizing effect upon troops. But as a form
of sport, there is little to be said for it. It is too
unfair. For this reason, among others, I was
glad when Davis turned homeward.</p>

<p>While coming back I climbed to five thousand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
metres, far above the others, and lagged a
long way behind them. This was a direct violation
of patrol discipline, and the result was,
that while cruising leisurely along, with motor
throttled down, watching the swift changes of
light over a wide expanse of cloud, I lost sight
of the group. Then came the inevitable feeling
of loneliness, and the swift realization that it
was growing late and that I was still far within
enemy country.</p>

<p>I held a southerly course, estimating, as I
flew, the velocity of the wind which had carried
us into Germany, and judging from this estimate
the length of time I should need to reach
our lines. When satisfied that I had gone far
enough, I started down. Below the clouds it
was almost night, so dark that I could not be
sure of my location. In the distance I saw a
large building, brilliantly lighted. This was
evidence enough that I was a good way from
the lines. Unshielded windows were never to
be seen near the front. I spiraled slowly down
over this building, examining, as well as I could,
the ground behind it, and decided to risk a
landing. A blind chance and blind luck attended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
it. In broad day, Drew hit the only
post in a field five hundred metres wide. At
night, a very dark night, I missed colliding
with an enormous factory chimney (a matter of
inches), glided over a line of telegraph wires,
passed at a few metres' height over a field littered
with huge piles of sugar beets, and settled,
<i>comme une fleur</i>, in a little cleared space which
I could never have judged accurately had I
known what I was doing.</p>

<p>Shadowy figures came running toward me.
Forgetting, in the joy of so fortunate a landing,
my anxiety of a moment before, I shouted out,
&#8220;Bonsoir, messieurs!&#8221; Then I heard some one
say, &#8220;Ich glaube&mdash;&#8221; losing the rest of it in the
sound of tramping feet and an undercurrent of
low, guttural murmurs. In a moment my Spad
was surrounded by a widening circle of round
hats, German infantrymen's hats.</p>

<p>Here was the ignoble end to my career as an
airman. I was a prisoner, a prisoner because of
my own folly, because I had dallied along like
a silly girl, to &#8220;look at the pretty clouds.&#8221; I
saw in front of me a long captivity embittered
by this thought. Not only this: my Spad was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
intact. The German authorities would examine
it, use it. Some German pilot might fly with it
over the lines, attack other French machines
with my gun, my ammunition!</p>

<p>Not if I could help it! They stood there,
those soldiers, gaping, muttering among themselves,
waiting, I thought, for an officer to tell
them what to do. I took off my leather gloves,
then my silk ones under them, and these I
washed about in the oil under my feet. Then,
as quietly as possible, I reached for my box of
matches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Qu'est-ce-que vous faites l&agrave;? Allez! Vite!&#8221;</p>

<p>A tramping of feet again, and a sea of round
hats bobbing up and down and vanishing in
the gloom. Then I heard a cheery &#8220;&Ccedil;a va,
monsieur? Pas de mal?&#8221; By way of answer I
lighted a match and held it out, torch fashion.
The light glistened on a round, red face and a
long French bayonet. Finally I said, &#8220;Vous &ecirc;tes
Fran&ccedil;ais, monsieur?&#8221; in a weak, watery voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mais oui, mon vieux! Mais oui!&#8221; this rather
testily. He didn't understand at first that I
thought myself in Germany. &#8220;Do I look like a
Boche?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I explained, and I have never heard a
Frenchman laugh more heartily. Then he explained
and I laughed, not so heartily, a great
deal more foolishly.</p>

<p>I may not give my location precisely. But I
shall be disclosing no military secrets in saying
that I am not in Germany. I am not even in
the French war-zone. I am closer to Paris than
I am to the enemy first-line trenches. In a little
while the sergeant with the round red face and
the long French bayonet, whose guest I am for
the night, will join me here. If he were an
American, to the manner born and bred, and if
he knew the cartoons of that man Briggs, he
might greet me in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have been on patrol a long way
behind the enemy lines, shooting up towns and
camps and railway trains like a pack of aerial
cowboys; when, on your way home, you have
deliberately disobeyed orders and loafed a long
way behind the other members of your group
in order to watch the pretty sunset, and, as a
punishment for this &aelig;sthetic indulgence, have
been overtaken by darkness and compelled to
land in strange country, only to have your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
machine immediately surrounded by German
soldiers; then, having taken the desperate resolve
that they shall not have possession of
your old battle-scarred <i>avion</i> as well as of your
person, when you are about to touch a match
to it, if the light glistens on a long French bayonet
and you learn that the German soldiers
have been prisoners since the battle of the
Somme, and have just finished their day's work
at harvesting beets to be used in making sugar
for French <i>poilus</i>&mdash;Oh, BOY! Ain't it a
GRAND AND GLORYUS FEELING?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nancy</span>, a moonlight night, and &#8220;les sales
Boches encore.&#8221; I have been out on the balcony
of this old hotel, a famous tourist resort
before the war, watching the bombardment
and listening to the deep throb of the motors of
German Gothas. They have dropped their
bombs without doing any serious damage.
Therefore, I may return in peace to my huge
bare room, to write, while it is still fresh in
mind, &#8220;The Adventure of the Camouflaged
Cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the past ten days I have been attached&mdash;it
is only a temporary transfer&mdash;to a
French <i>escadrille</i> of which Manning, an American,
is a member. The <i>escadrille</i> had just been
sent to a quiet part of the front for two weeks'
<i>repos</i>, but the day after my arrival orders came
to fly to Belfort, for special duty.</p>

<p>Belfort! On the other side of the Vosges
Mountains, with the Rhine Valley, the Alps,
within view, within easy flying distance! And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
for special duty. It is a vague order which may
mean anything. We discussed its probable
meaning for us, while we were pricking out our
course on our maps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Protection of bombardment <i>avions</i>&#8221; was Andr&eacute;'s
guess. &#8220;Night combat&#8221; was Raynaud's.
Every one laughed at this last hazard. &#8220;You
see?&#8221; he said, appealing to me, the newcomer.
&#8220;They think I am big fool. But wait.&#8221; Then,
breaking into French, in order to express himself
more fluently: &#8220;It is coming soon, <i>chasse
de nuit</i>. It is not at all impossible. One can
see at night, a moonlight night, very clearly
from the air. They are black shadows, the
other <i>avions</i> which you pass, but often, when
the moonlight strikes their wings, they flash
like silver. We must have searchlights, of
course; then, when one sees those shadows,
those great black Gothas, <i>vite! la lumi&egrave;re!</i>
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop! C'est fini!&#8221;</p>

<p>The discussion of the possibility or impossibility
of night combat continued warmly. The
majority of opinion was unfavorable to it: a
useless waste of gasoline; the results would
not pay for the wear and tear upon valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
fighting planes. Raynaud was not to be persuaded.
&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; he said. There was a
reminiscent thrill in his voice, for he is an old
night bombarding pilot. He remembered with
longing, I think, his romantic night voyages,
the moonlight falling softly on the roofs of
towns, the rivers like ribbons of silver, the forests
patches of black shadow. &#8220;Really, it is
an adventure, a night bombardment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about your objectives?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;At night you can never be sure of hitting them,
and, well, you know what happens in French
towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is why I asked for my transfer to <i>chasse</i>,&#8221;
he told me afterward. &#8220;But the Germans, the
blond beasts! Do they care? Nancy, Belfort,
Ch&acirc;lons, Epernay, Rheims, Soissons, Paris,&mdash;all
our beautiful towns! I am a fool! We must
pay them back, the Huns! Let the innocent
suffer with the guilty!&#8221;</p>

<p>He became a combat pilot because he had
not the courage of his conviction.</p>

<p>We started in flights of five machines, following
the Marne and the Marne Canal to Bar-le-Duc,
then across country to Toul, where we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
landed to fill our fuel tanks. Having bestowed
many favors upon me for a remarkably long
period, our aerial godfather decided that I had
been taking my good fortune too much for
granted. Therefore, he broke my tail skid for
me as I was making what I thought a beautiful
<i>atterrissage</i>. It was late in the afternoon, so the
others went on without me, the captain giving
orders that I should join them, weather permitting,
the next day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow the Moselle until you lose it in
the mountains. Then pick up the road which
leads over the Ballon d'Alsace. You can't miss
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did, nevertheless, and as always, when lost,
through my own fault. I followed the Moselle
easily enough until it disappeared in small
branching streams in the heart of the mountains.
Then, being certain of my direction, I
followed an irregular course, looking down from
a great height upon scores of little mountain
villages, untouched by war. After weeks of
flying over the desolation of more northerly
sectors of the front, this little indulgence seemed
to me quite a legitimate one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>But my Spad (I was always flying tired old
<i>avions</i> in those days, the discards of older
pilots) began to show signs of fatigue. The
pressure went down. Neither motor nor hand
pump would function, the engine began to gasp,
and, although I instantly switched on to my
reserve tank, it expired with shuddering coughs.
The propeller, after making a few spins in the
reverse direction, stopped dead.</p>

<p>I had been in a most comfortable frame of
mind all the way, for a long cross-country aerial
journey, well behind the zone of fire, is a welcome
relaxation after combat patrols. It is
odd how quickly one's attitude toward rugged,
beautiful country changes, when one is faced
with the necessity of finding landing-ground
there. The steep ravines yawn like mouths.
The peaks of the mountains are teeth&mdash;ragged,
sinister-looking teeth. Being at five thousand
metres I had ample time in which to make a
choice&mdash;ample time, too, for wondering if,
by a miscalculation, I had crossed the trench
lines, which in that region are hardly visible
from the air.</p>

<p>I searched anxiously for a wide valley where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
it would be possible to land in safety. While
still three thousand metres from the ground I
found one. Not only a field. There were <i>bessonneau</i>
hangars on it. An aerodrome! A moment
of joy,&mdash;&#8220;but German, perhaps!&#8221;&mdash;followed
by another of anxiety. It was quickly
relieved by the sight of a French reconnaissance
plane spiraling down for a landing. I landed,
too, and found that I was only a ten-minutes'
flight from my destination.</p>


<p style="padding-top: 1.5em">With other work to do, I did not finish the
story of my adventure with the camouflaged
cows, and I am wondering now why I thought
it such a corking one. The cows had something
to do with it. We were returning from Belfort
to Verdun when I met them. Our special duty
had been to furnish aerial protection to the
King of Italy, who was visiting the French lines
in the Vosges. This done we started northward
again. Over the highest of the mountains my
motor pump failed as before. I got well past
the mountains before the essence in my reserve
tank gave out. Then I planed as flatly as possible,
searching for another aviation field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
There were none to be found in this region,
rough, hilly country, much of it covered with
forests. I chose a miniature sugar-loaf mountain
for landing-ground. It appeared to be free
from obstacles, and the summit, which was pasture
and ploughed land, seemed wide enough to
settle on.</p>

<p>I got the direction of the wind from the
smoke blowing from the chimneys of a near-by
village, and turned into it. As I approached,
the hill loomed more and more steeply in front
of me. I had to pull up at a climbing angle to
keep from nosing into the side of it. About this
time I saw the cows, dozens of them, grazing
over the whole place. Their natural <i>camouflage</i>
of browns and whites and reds prevented my
seeing them earlier. Making spectacular <i>virages</i>,
I missed collisions by the length of a
match-stick. At the summit of the hill, my
wheels touched ground for the first time, and
I bounded on, going through a three-strand
wire fence and taking off a post without any
appreciable decrease in speed. Passing between
two large apple trees, I took limbs from each
of them, losing my wings in doing so. My landing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
chassis was intact and my Spad went on
down the reverse slope&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Like an embodied joy, whose race is just begun.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After crashing through a thicket of brush and
small trees, I came to rest, both in body and in
mind, against a stone wall. There was nothing
left of my machine but the seat. Unscathed, I
looked back along the wreckage-strewn path,
like a man who has been riding a whirlwind in
a wicker chair.</p>

<p>Now, I have never yet made a forced landing
in strange country without having the mayor of
the nearest village appear on the scene very
soon afterward. I am beginning to believe that
the mayors of all French towns sit on the roofs
of their houses, field-glasses in hand, searching
the sky for wayward aviators, and when they
see one landing, they rush to the spot on foot,
on horseback, in old-fashioned family phaetons,
by means of whatever conveyance most likely to
increase expedition their municipality affords.</p>

<p>The mayor of V.-sur-I. came on foot, for he
had not far to go. Indeed, had there been one
more cow browsing between the apple trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
I should have made a last <i>virage</i> to the left, in
which case I should have piled up against a
summer pavilion in the mayor's garden. Like
all French mayors of my experience, he was a
courteous, big-hearted gentleman.</p>

<p>After getting his breath,&mdash;he was a fleshy
man, and had run all the way from his house,&mdash;he
said, &#8220;Now, my boy, what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>First he placed a guard around the wreckage
of my machine; then we had tea in the summer
pavilion, where I explained the reason for my
sudden visit. While I was telling him the story,
I noticed that every window of the house, which
stood at one end of the garden, was crowded
with children's heads. War orphans, I guessed.
Either that or the children of a large family of
sons at the front. He was the kind of man who
would take them all into his own home.</p>

<p>Having frightened his cows,&mdash;they must
have given cottage cheese for a week afterward,&mdash;destroyed
his fences, broken his apple trees,
accepted his hospitality, I had the amazing
nerve to borrow money from him. I had no
choice in the matter, for I was a long way from
Verdun, with only eighty centimes in my pocket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Had there been time I would have walked
rather than ask him for the loan. He granted it
gladly, and insisted upon giving me double the
amount which I required.</p>

<p>I promised to go back some day for a visit.
First I will do acrobacy over the church steeple,
and then, if the cows are not in the pasture, I
am going to land, <i>comme une fleur</i>, as we airmen
say, on that hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is mid-January, snowing, blowing, the thermometer
below zero. We have done no flying
for five days. We have read our most recent
magazines from cover to cover, including the
advertisements, many of which we find more
interesting, better written, than the stories. We
have played our latest phonograph record for
the five hundred and ninety-eighth time. Now
we are hugging our one stove, which is no larger
than a length of good American stove-pipe, in
the absurd hope of getting a fleeting promise
of heat.</p>

<p>Boredom, insufferable boredom. There is no
American expression&mdash;there will be soon, no
doubt&mdash;for this disease which claims so many
victims from the Channel coast to the borders
of Switzerland. The British have it without
giving it a name. They say &#8220;Fed up and far
from home.&#8221; The more inventive French call
it &#8220;Cafard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our outlook upon life is warped, or, to use a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
more seasonable expression, frozen. We are not
ourselves. We make sarcastic remarks about
one another. We hold up for ridicule individual
peculiarities of individuality. Some one, tiring
of this form of indoor sports, starts the phonograph
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Pete! Shut off that damn
silly thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admire your taste, Irving!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what will you have, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play that Russian thing, the 'Danse des
Buffons.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't play anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord! I wish some one would send us some
new records.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, instead of knitted wristers&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And mufflers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about wristers, how many pair do
you think I've received? Eight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try to head 'em off. Doesn't do any
good. They keep coming just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It's because they are easy to make. Working
wristers and mufflers is a method of dodging
the knitting draft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I call that gratitude! You don't
deserve to have any friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn't it the truth? Have you ever known
of a soldier or an aviator who wore wristers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give mine to my mechanician. He sends
them home, and his wife unravels the yarn and
makes sweaters for the youngsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the waste energy. Harness up the
wrist-power and you could keep three aircraft
factories going day and night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if it amuses the women, what's
the difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's not the way to look at it. They
ought to be doing something useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of them are; don't forget that, old
son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody got anything to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if they would send us more books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And magazines&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago, Blake, you were wishing
they wouldn't send so many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? We were having fine weather
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ought to be some system about sending
parcels to the front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Germans have it, they say. Soldier
wants a book, on engineering, for example, or a
history, or an anthology of recent poetry. Gets
it at once through Government channels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what you like about the Boches, they
don't know the meaning of waste energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can't have method and efficiency
in a democracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go! Same old fallacy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fallacy about it! Efficiency and personal
freedom don't go together. They never
have and they never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what does our personal freedom
amount to? When you get down to brass tacks,
personal freedom is a mighty poor name for it,
speaking for four fifths of the population.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Germany doesn't want it, our brand, and
we can't force it on her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And without it, she has a mighty good
chance of winning this war&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>When the talk begins with the uselessness of
wristers, shifts from that to democratic inefficiency,
and from that to the probability of
<i>Deutschland &uuml;ber Alles</i>, you may be certain of
the diagnosis. The disease is <i>cafard</i>.</p>

<p>The sound of a motor-car approaching. Dunham
rushes to the window and then swears,
remembering our greased-cloth window panes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and see who it is, Tiffin, will you? Hope
it's the mail orderly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tiffin goes on outpost and reports three
civilians approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, who can they be, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Newspaper men probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord! I hope not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another American mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's my guess, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rodman is right. It is another American
mission coming to &#8220;study conditions&#8221; at the
front.</p>

<p>&#8220;But unofficially, gentlemen, quite unofficially,&#8221;
says Mr. A., its head, a tall, melancholy-looking
man, with a deep, bell-like voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Mr. B., the second member of the mission, is in
direct contrast, a birdlike little man, who twitters
about the room, from group to group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! If you boys only knew how <i>splendid</i>
you are! How much we in America&mdash;You are
our <i>first</i> representatives at the front, you know.
You are the vanguard of the <i>millions</i> who&mdash;&#8221;
etc.</p>

<p>Miller looks at me solemnly. His eyes are
saying, &#8220;How long, O Lord, how long!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. C., the third member, is a silent man.
He has keen, deep-set eyes. &#8220;There,&#8221; we say,
&#8220;is the brain of the mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tea is served very informally. Mr. A. is
restless. He has something on his mind. Presently
he turns to Lieutenant Talbott.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I say a few words to your squadron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; says Talbott, glancing at us
uneasily.</p>

<p>Mr. A. rises, steps behind his chair, clears
his throat, and looks down the table where ten
pilots,&mdash;the others are taking a constitutional
in the country,&mdash;caught in n&eacute;glig&eacute;e attire by
the unexpected visitors, are sitting in attitudes
of polite attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;My friends&mdash;&#8221; the deep, bell-like voice.
In fancy, I hear a great shifting of chairs, and
following the melancholy eyes with my own,
over the heads of my ten fellow pilots, beyond
the limits of our poor little messroom, I see a
long vista of polished shirt fronts, a diminishing
track of snowy linen, shimmering wineglasses,
shining silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, believe me when I say that this
occasion is one of the proudest and happiest of
my life. I am standing within sound of the
guns which for three&mdash;long&mdash;years have been
battering at the bulwarks of civilization. I hear
them, as I utter these words, and I look into the
faces of a little group of Americans who, day
after day, and week after week&#8221; (increasing
emphasis) &#8220;have been facing those guns for the
honor and glory of democratic institutions&#8221;
(rising inflection).</p>

<p>&#8220;We in America have heard them, faintly,
perhaps, yet unmistakably, and now I come to
tell you, in the words of that glorious old war
song, 'We are coming, Father Woodrow, ONE
HUN-DRED MIL-LION strong!'&#8221;</p>

<p>We listen through to the end, and Lieutenant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Talbott, in his official capacity, begins to applaud.
The rest of us join in timidly, self-consciously.
I am surprised to find how awkwardly
we do it. We have almost forgotten how
to clap our hands! My sense of the spirit of
place changes suddenly. I am in America. I
am my old self there, with different thoughts,
different emotions. I see everything from my
old point of view. I am like a man who has forgotten
his identity. I do not recover my old, or,
better, my new one, until our guests have gone.</p>

<p>I've been wondering about the ultimate
fate of my poor old &#8220;High Adventure&#8221; story,
whether it was published without those long
promised concluding chapters which I really
should have sent on had I not had the misfortune
to be taken prisoner. I hope the book has
been published, incomplete as it is. Not that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
am particularly proud of it as a piece of literature!</p>

<p>I told you briefly, on my card, how I happened
to be taken prisoner. We were a patrol
of three and attacked a German formation at
some distance behind their lines. I was diving
vertically on an Albatross when my upper
right plane gave way under the strain. Fortunately,
the structure of the wing did not
break. It was only the fabric covering it,
which ripped off in great strips. I immediately
turned toward our lines and should have
reached them, I believe, even in my crippled
condition; but by that time I was very low
and under a heavy fire from the ground. A
German anti-air craft battery made a direct
hit on my motor. It was a terrific smash and
almost knocked the motor out of the frame.
My machine went down in a spin and I had
another of those moments of intense fear common
to the experience of aviators. Well, by
Jove! I hardly know how I managed it, but I
kept from crashing nose down. I struck the
ground at an angle of about 30 degrees, the
motor, which was just hanging on, spilled out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and I went skidding along, with the fuselage of
the machine, the landing chassis having been
snapped off as though the braces were so
many toothpicks. One of my ankles was
broken and the other one sprained, and my
poor old nose received and withstood a severe
contact with my wind-shield. I've been in
hospital ever since until a week ago, when I
was sent to this temporary camp to await assignment
to a permanent one. I now hobble
about fairly well with the help of a stick, although
I am to be a lame duck for several
months to come, I believe.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the lot of a prisoner of war
is not a happy one. The hardest part of it is,
of course, the loss of personal liberty. Oh! I
shall know how to appreciate that when I have
it again. But we are well treated here. Our
quarters are comfortable and pleasant, and
the food as good as we have any right to expect.
My own experience as a prisoner of war
and that of all the Frenchmen and Englishmen
here with whom I have talked, leads me to believe
that some of those tales of escaped or exchanged
prisoners must have been highly imaginative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Not that we are enjoying all the
comforts of home. On the contrary, a fifteen-cent
lunch at a Child's restaurant would seem a
feast to me, and a piece of milk chocolate&mdash;are
there such luxuries as chocolate in the
world? But for prisoners, I for one, up to this
point, have no complaint to make with respect
to our treatment. We have a splendid little
library here which British and French officers
who have preceded us have collected. I didn't
realize, until I saw it, how book-hungry I was.
Now I'm cramming history, biography, essays,
novels. I know that I'm not reading
with any judgment but I'll soon settle down
to a more profitable enjoyment of my leisure.
Yesterday and to-day I've been reading &#8220;The
Spoils of Poynton,&#8221; by Henry James. It is absurd
to try cramming these. I've been longing
for this opportunity to read Henry James,
knowing that he was Joseph Conrad's master.
&#8220;The Spoils of Poynton&#8221; has given me a foretaste
of the pleasure I'm to have. A prisoner
of war has his compensations. Here I've come
out of the turmoil of a life of the most intense
nervous excitement, a life lived day to day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with no thought of to-morrow, into this other
life of unlimited bookish leisure.</p>

<p>We are like monks in a convent. We're almost
entirely out of touch with the outside
world. We hear rumors of what is taking place
at the front, and now and then get a budget of
stale news from newly arrived prisoners. But
for all this we are so completely out of it all
that it seems as though the war must have
come to an end. Until now this cloistered life
has been very pleasant. I've had time to think
and to make plans for a future which, comparatively
speaking, seems assured. One has
periods of restlessness, of course. When these
come I console myself as best I may. Even for
prisoners of war there are possibilities for quite
interesting adventure, adventure in companionship.
Thrown into such intimate relationships
as we are here, and under these peculiar
circumstances, we make rather surprising discoveries
about ourselves and about each other.
There are obvious superficial effects which I
can trace back to causes quite easily. But
there are others which have me guessing. By
Jove! this is an interesting place! Conrad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
would find material here which would set him
to work at once. I can imagine how he would
revel in it.</p>

<p>Well, I'm getting to be a very wise man.
I'm deeply learned in many kinds, or, better,
phases, of human psychology and I'm increasing
my fund of knowledge every day. Therefore,
I've decided that, when the war is over,
I'll be no more a wanderer. I'll settle down in
Boston for nine months out of the year and
create deathless literature. And for vacations,
I've already planned the first one, which is to
be a three months' jaunt by aeroplane up and
down the United States east and west, north
and south. You will see the possibilities of adventure
in a trip of this sort. By limiting myself
somewhat as to itinerary I can do the
thing. I've found just the man here to share
the journey with, an American in the British
Air Force. He is enthusiastic about the plan.
If only I can keep him from getting married
for a year or so after getting home!</p>

<p>I had a very interesting experience, immediately
after being taken prisoner on May 7th. I
was taken by some German aviators to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
aerodrome and had lunch with them before I
was sent on to the hospital. Some of them
spoke English and some of them French, so
that there was no difficulty in conversing. I
was suffering a good deal from my twisted
ankles and had to be guarded in my remarks
because of the danger of disclosing military
information; but they were a fine lot of fellows.
They respected my reticence, and did all they
could to make me comfortable. It was with
pilots from this squadron that we had been
fighting only an hour or so before. One of
their number had been killed in the combat by
one of the boys who was flying with me. I sat
beside the fellow whom I was attacking when
my wing broke. I was right &#8220;on his tail,&#8221; as
we airmen say, when the accident occurred,
and had just opened fire. Talking over the
combat with him in their pleasant quarters, I
was heartily glad that my affair ended as it
did. I asked them to tell me frankly if they
did not feel rather bitterly toward me as one of
an enemy patrol which had shot down a comrade
of theirs. They seemed to be surprised
that I had any suspicions on this score. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
had &#8220;a fair fight in an open field.&#8221; Why
should there be any bitterness about the result.
One of them said to me, &#8220;Hauptmann,
you'll find that we Germans are enemies of a
country in war, but never of the individual.&#8221;
My experience thus far leads me to believe
that this is true. There have been a few exceptions,
but they were uneducated common
soldiers. Bitterness toward America there
certainly is everywhere, and an intense hatred
of President Wilson quite equal in degree
and kind to the hatred in America of the
emperor....</p>
